<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>For consistency and clarity, a space (when absent) has been placed
between the number and the unit of weight lb. and lbs. giving
for example '21 lbs.' in place of '21lbs.'</p>

<p>Fractions, usually in the form '14 3-4' in the original text,
have been converted to the form '14<span class="xs"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>' in this etext.</p>

<p>Also, in a few larger tables with italic styling on some text, this
italic styling has been removed, for consistency with the .txt version.
In a few cases a word has been abbreviated to conserve table space:
    cal. = caliber; diam. = diameter.</p>

<p>Some instances of <i>Tome</i> in French citations have been changed
to Tome (no italic), for consistency.</p>

<p>Some accents and spelling in French citations have been corrected.</p>

<p>For consistency, instances of 'fireworks' and 'fire works' have
been changed to the predominant form 'fire-works'.</p>

<p>Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been
corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within
the text and consultation of external sources.</p>

<p class="customcover">The cover image was created by the transcriber
and is placed in the public domain.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p>In submitting the present work to the public, it
may be proper to state some of the difficulties, under
which it has been published, and to bespeak an indulgent
allowance for any imperfections, which may
be observed in the style or arrangement. As a posthumous
work, it has been deprived of those final improvements
and emendations, which are generally
made by Authors, while their works are in progress
of publication. While, however, the work has laboured
under these disadvantages, the publisher has felt
it her duty to make every arrangement, to supply, as
far as possible, the want of the author's personal superintendence
of the publication. This course was
due to the scientific reputation of her late husband,
as well as to the numerous and generous patrons of
the work.</p>

<h2><a name="INTx" id="INTx">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>

<p>In presenting this work to the public as a system of Pyrotechny,
which, we have reason to believe, is the only full and connected
system that has appeared, we may be permitted to remark,
that, in our arrangement of the subject, we have appropriated separate
heads for each article.</p>

<p>This plan, of the subject being considered in chapters and sections,
and forming with the divisions of the work, a connected system
of arrangement, enables the reader to have a full view of the
whole, and, at the same time, all the facts in detail belonging to
the chapter, or section under consideration. By referring to the
Table of Contents, this plan will be seen without further comment.
The arrangement of the different articles in this manner, necessarily
comprehends in the onset all the substances, which are employed
in various preparations. In considering this part of our
subject, we have given the chemical characters, or peculiar properties
of each substance respectively; by which a rationale of pyrotechnical
effects may be the better understood, and, consequently,
the action of bodies on each other better illustrated.</p>

<p>In this part we also comprehend the General Theory of Fire-works,
which it may be proper to remark, we have drawn from
the known effects of chemical action; so far, at least, as the laws,
of affinity, which govern such action, are applicable to the subject.
The importance of this inquiry, although having no relation to the
mere manipulations of the artificer, can not be doubted; since a
knowledge of chemistry has already improved the preparation of
gunpowder, and its effects are now known to be owing to the formation
of sundry elastic aeriform fluids. On this head, that of the
application of chemistry to Pyrotechny, we claim so much originality,
as, so far as we know, to have been the first, who applied
the principles of chemistry.</p>

<p>It is not to be expected in every instance, that a rationale of
the decomposition as it occurs, or the order in which it takes place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
can be given with certainty; because, where a variety of substances
enter into the same preparation, which is frequently the case,
the affinities become complicated, and the laws of action for that
reason indeterminate, and frequently anomalous. But, on the contrary,
in a variety of primary operating causes, by which effects
analogous in their nature result, decomposition of course being the
same, the causes are well understood, and the effects are thereby
known, and duly appreciated.</p>

<p>This, for instance, is the case with a mixture of nitrate of potassa,
charcoal, and sulphur, in the proportion necessary to form gunpowder;
for, it is known, that the explosive effects of powder are
owing to the sudden production of a number of gases, which suffer
dilatation by the immense quantity of caloric liberated at the
moment of combustion. Although the production of caloric by the
inflammation of gunpowder is a case, which cannot be explained
by the present received theory of combustion, as we have noticed
in that article; yet we know that it is a fact, and that caloric is
generated by the decomposition of the powder.</p>

<p>If we consider the primary cause of this decomposition, we naturally
inquire into the products of the combustion, and endeavour
to account for the production of the elastic aeriform fluids. We
know that carbon has the property of decomposing nitric acid, and
also nitrate of potassa; for, when it is brought in contact in the state
of ignition with nitre, a deflagration will ensue, and carbonic acid
be formed. The quantity of this acid is in the direct <i>ratio</i> to the
quantity of oxygen required to <i>saturate</i> a given quantity of carbon;
and therefore, by employing certain proportions of nitre and charcoal,
the latter will decompose the former, and by abstracting its
oxygen, on the same principle form carbonic acid, while the azote,
the other constituent of nitric acid, will be set at liberty. Nor is
this all, if we consider the action of sulphur. The sulphur must
unite with one portion of the oxygen to produce sulphurous acid
gas, and also with the potassa of the nitre, and form a sulphuret, a
compound necessary to be formed, before we can explain the production
of sulphuretted hydrogen gas, which results from the decomposition
of water contained in the nitre. There also results,
as a product, sulphate of potassa. In considering these products
at large, it would be necessary to go into detail; and, as we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
descanted largely on its combustion in gunpowder, we accordingly
refer the reader to the article on <i>Gunpowder</i>. It will be sufficient,
however, to remark, that the <i>agent</i>, and consequently the
cause, which produces the decomposition of nitrate of potassa, is
carbon or charcoal. This, by uniting with the greater part of the
oxygen of the nitre, produces, in a determinate proportion, carbonic
acid gas. This gas, therefore, in conjunction with other
gases, formed at the same time, all of which being expanded, causes
what is denominated the <i>explosive effect</i> of gunpowder.</p>

<p>We have then a primary cause of the decomposition, and most
of the effective force of gunpowder is owing to the carbonic acid;
and it is found, that gunpowder made without sulphur is equally
powerful as that with, since it adds nothing to its power.</p>

<p>Causes, therefore, chemically speaking, operate alike under
similar circumstances. The materials made use of being equally
pure, and used in the same proportion, the effect must necessarily
be the same.</p>

<p>It is not only in the instance we have mentioned, but in every
other, in which chemical action ensues, that this doctrine is tenable.
We might, indeed, notice a number of cases of a similar
kind; as, for instance, in the combustion of many incendiary preparations,
as fire-stone, fire-rain, composition for carcasses, light-balls,
and a variety of fire-works of the same kind. If we mix
pitch, tar, tallow, &amp;c. with nitrate of potassa, and burn the mixture,
we have the combined action of two elementary substances,
which enter into the composition of these bodies, namely, carbon
and hydrogen. The products would be carbonic acid gas, and
water; because the oxygen of the nitre would unite with the hydrogen,
as well as the carbon. If we employ sulphur at the same
time, another product would be sulphurous acid gas, and probably
sulphuric acid; and if gunpowder be used, as in the <i>fire-stone</i> composition,
then, besides these products, we would have those of the
gunpowder.</p>

<p>As this subject, however interesting to the theoretical pyrotechnist,
cannot be understood without a knowledge of chemistry, it
is obvious, that that science is a powerful aid to pyrotechny. It is
unnecessary to dwell on this head. We may add, nevertheless
that, in order to understand the effect of all mixtures, or compo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>sitions
made use of, it is necessary to consider the nature of the
substances employed, and the manner in which chemical action
takes place, and consequently the products, which determine in
fact the characteristic property of each species of fire-work, and
the phenomena on which it is predicated. All products of combustion
depend on the substances thus decomposed, and by knowing
the effects, we may readily refer them to their proper causes.</p>

<p>With respect to <i>caloric</i>, it may not be improper to offer some
remarks.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The hypothetical element of phlogiston having given
way to the antiphlogistic theory at present received, our ideas
respecting caloric are predicated on facts. Caloric is a term,
which expresses heat, or matter of heat. In pyrotechny, we have
merely to consider it in a free, or uncombined state; but as the
subject is interesting, we purpose to notice it very briefly under
the following heads: viz. its nature; the manner it is set in motion;
its tendency to a state of rest; the changes it produces on bodies;
and the instruments for measuring its intensity.</p>

<p>As to the nature of caloric, different opinions are entertained.
We know the effect of heat: if we touch a substance of a higher
temperature than our bodies, we call it hot, and <i>vice versa</i>. The
one is evidently the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'accesssion'">accession</ins>, and the other the abstraction,
of caloric. The latter is merely relative as respects ourselves;
for the effect depends on our feelings, and the sensation of hot or
cold is therefore governed by them.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Caloric, however, is considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>to be a substance, composed of inconceivably small particles;
but count Rumford and sir H. Davy are of a contrary opinion,
namely, that it depends upon a peculiar motion and not on
a subtle fluid.</p>

<p>As the effect of caloric, according to their view, depends on
motion, the agencies by which this is effected are of the first importance.
That it exists in all bodies in a state of rest, and in
a greater or smaller quantity, and consequently in a relative proportion,
is well known, and on this, the capacities of bodies for
caloric is founded. The capacities of bodies for heat are changed
by various means, and caloric is put in motion; and, according to
its quantity, the bodies may be either cold or hot. When the surrounding
bodies become heated, they receive this caloric thus set
free, and, in this view, the absolute quantity of their heat is increased.
This state of rest, to which caloric is subject, may be
destroyed either by an increase or a diminution of the capacity
of a body. If caloric be put in motion by causes of any kind,
which influence the capacities of different bodies, a theory maintained
by Davy, then as the capacity for heat is changed so is free
heat produced. Diminish the capacity of a body, its excess will
of course be given out, and distribute itself among the surrounding
bodies, which become heated; but increase the capacity, and
a different effect ensues. The body absorbs caloric, by which its
capacity is increased, and cold is produced. Caloric, whether
considered a substance, or an attribute, possesses, nevertheless,
this property, that when it is given out, as in the mixture of sulphuric
acid and water, which occupies a less space than both in a
separate state, the sensation of heat follows; and when it is absorbed,
as in the various freezing mixtures, or in a mixture of
snow and common salt, the sensation of cold is excited. The causes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>however, which set caloric in motion, or that produce heat,
are such as combustion, condensation, friction, chemical mixture,
and the like. It is remarkable, that these effects are invariably
the same, and are affected by corresponding affinities. When a
piece of iron is struck with a hammer, the percussion produces a
condensation of the iron, its specific gravity is increased, and
the iron finally becomes ignited. The condensation of air, in the
condensing syringe, will set fire to tinder. The flint and steel
produce a condensation; for the metal, although small, is sent off
in scintillations in the state of ignition. That caloric is contained
in bodies in the state of absolute rest, and is evolved by condensation,
there is no doubt. Gunpowder, by percussion, in contact
with pulverized glass, is inflamed; and it appears very probable,
that it also contains caloric in a state of rest. The experiments
of Lavoisier and Laplace, on the quantity of caloric actually absorbed
in nitric acid, and in a latent state, (noticed in the article
on <i>gunpowder</i>), are satisfactory. If caloric is not in that state in
nitre, how are we to explain the sudden transmission or evolution
of caloric in fired gunpowder, where no external agent in any
manner can influence the formation, or disengagement of caloric?
Friction or attrition produces heat; and the distributable excess
of caloric, as it is called, although not satisfactorily accounted for,
may arise from a condensation; which, however, is denied.</p>

<p>The Esquimaux Indians kindle a fire, very expeditiously, in
the following manner: They prepare two pieces of dry wood, and
making a small hole in each, fit into them a little cylindrical piece
of wood, round which a thong is put. Then, by pulling the ends of
this thong, they whirl the cylindrical piece about with such velocity,
that the motion sets the wood on fire, when lighting a little dry
moss, which serves for tinder, they make as large a fire as they
please; but as the little timber they have is drift wood, this fails
them in the winter, and they are then obliged to make use of their
lamps for the supply of their family occasions. <cite>Ellis's Voyage for
the Discovery of a North-West Passage.</cite></p>

<p>Friction is, therefore, one means of producing distributable heat,
which is also exemplified very frequently in the axis of a carriage
wheel; of mill work; in the rubbing of wood, when turned on its
axis in a lathe, by which turners ornament their work with black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
rings; rubbing a cord very swiftly backwards and forwards against
a post or tree, or letting it run over a boat, &amp;c. as in the whale
fishery; the motion of two iron plates against each other, pressing
them at the same time, &amp;c. The great object in the construction
of machines is to avoid, or lessen the degree of friction. See
Hatchette, Vince, and Gregory. Count Rumford (Nicholson's
Journal, 4th edit. ii, 106), and professor Pictet (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Essai sur le Feu</cite>,
chap. ix.) have made some valuable experiments on heat evolved
by friction.</p>

<p>The sun is one great source of caloric. In whatever mode it
produces it, whether by giving it out from its own substance, by
the action of light on the air that surrounds the globe; by the concentration
of calorific rays by means of the atmosphere, acting as
a lens; or by putting caloric in the distributable state, always pre-existing
in some other, as in a state of rest, are questions, which, in
our present state of knowledge, we are unable to solve. We know
the fact, and that the caloric is of the same nature as that obtained
by combustion.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span></p>

<p>Combustion is a process by which caloric is put in a distributable
state. The opinion of Stahl and others, that all combustible
bodies contained a certain principle called phlogiston, to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
they owed their combustibility, and that combustion was nothing
more than a separation of this principle, gave rise to the phlogistic
or Stahlian theory, which was afterwards modified by Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
Priestley. But his theory is equally untenable. Kirwan's opinion
was no less vague, although he substituted hydrogen for phlogiston.</p>

<p>The Lavoiserian, or antiphlogistic theory overturned the Stahlian.
According to this theory, a combustible in burning unites
with oxygen, and heat and light are given out by the gas, and not
from the combustible. According to a modified theory of the above,
by Dr. Thomson, caloric is evolved by the gas, and light from the
burning body. Without noticing the instances, in which this theory,
as a general one, is insufficient to explain the cause of combustion,
or of the production of heat and light, we will merely remark,
that bodies which support combustion are called supporters,
as oxygen gas, chlorine gas, &amp;c. and those, that undergo this change,
are named combustible bodies.</p>

<p>The products of combustion may be fixed or gaseous, and either
alkalies, oxides, or acids; or, when chlorine is the supporter, chlorides,
&amp;c. A few examples will be sufficient. By the combustion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
of metals, iron for instance, we obtain a fixed product, and in the
present case an oxide of iron; by the combustion of antimony and
arsenic, the antimonic and arsenic acids; by the combustion of
charcoal, we have carbonic acid gas, a gaseous product; by the combustion
of potassium or sodium, we obtain a fixed alkali, depending
however on the quantity of oxygen; by the combustion of sulphur,
phosphorus, &amp;c. acids; and when metals are burnt in chlorine
gas, chlorides are produced.</p>

<p>It is evident from facts, that, whatever theory may be assumed,
combustion occasions the production of <i>free</i> caloric, or changes the
<i>condition</i> of caloric, from quiescent to distributable heat. The
conclusions drawn by Mr. Davy and others, appear to have been
predicated on the absorption of the base, and development of caloric,
as in oxygen gas, and the peculiar alteration in bodies implying
a decrease in their capacity; and hence, as regards the
products of combustion, they must necessarily possess a less capacity
for heat than the mean capacity of their constituents.</p>

<p>Whether we regard heat as latent, in the acceptation of the
term, as applied or used by Dr. Black, or quiescent, or in a state of
rest, it is certainly evident, that combustion is a chemical change,
and by it caloric passes from a combined to an uncombined state,
and is thus made sensible, free, or thermometrical heat. Combustion
may, as it certainly does, put quiescent heat in a distributable
state; but this quiescent heat is the same in the present case,
of which there can be no doubt, as latent caloric. The thermometer
will only indicate as much caloric in the air as is in a distributable,
or free state; but, if the same air be employed to supply,
or support combustion, the heat, rendered appreciable by the senses
and the thermometer, will be in the ratio of the decomposition
of the oxygen gas of the atmosphere, and, of course, to the development
of free caloric.</p>

<p>Chemical combination, such as occurs by the mixture of fluids,
as <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'alchohol'">alcohol</ins> and water, sulphuric acid and water, some of the gases,
as muriatic acid gas with water, &amp;c. evolves heat, and sometimes
sufficient to boil water. In cases of spontaneous combustion, it
would seem, that quiescent heat passes to the state of distributable
heat; for if nitric acid, for instance, contains so large a quantity
of quiescent heat, or fixed heat, as the experiments of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
Lavoisier make it appear, we may readily explain why spontaneous
combustion ensues, when that acid is brought in contact with
spirits of turpentine; because the chemical action of the acid on
the carbon and hydrogen of the turpentine, which takes place,
produces at the same time a corresponding change in the caloric
itself, from a quiescent to a distributable state. If the same data
be admissible with regard to the combination of the nitric acid
with potassa, which we may judge to be the case by the experiments
of Lavoisier and Laplace, (quoted in our article on <i>Gunpowder</i>),
then, indeed, its mechanical union with charcoal, and sulphur,
although in a common temperature no combustion ensues, will, at
the temperature required to inflame the mixture, (about 700 degrees
according to some), produce a decomposition altogether
chemical; and while new products are formed, the caloric, necessary
also for their generation, passes from a quiescent to a distributable
state; and a portion of it goes into a new state of combination,
also quiescent. We mean that portion which is necessary
for the constitution of gaseous fluids. This fact is remarkable.
By referring to the original state or condition of the caloric, if we
admit that state in the present instance, (which appears the only
mode of accounting for the emanation of free caloric by the combustion
of gunpowder), it is easily perceived, that chemical changes,
besides the usual supporters of combustion being concerned,
as in ordinary cases of combustion, must produce a similar change
in the state of combined or quiescent heat.</p>

<p>Predicating this opinion on the results of the experiments of MM.
Lavoisier and Laplace, and seeing that gunpowder inflames
<i>per se</i>, or without the aid of a gaseous supporter, we have no hesitation
in risking it, in the present state of our knowledge concerning
heat as our present belief and conviction. Although there
is no satisfactory theory offered to explain all the instances of
spontaneous combustion, yet it seems reasonable to conclude, that
in many cases at least, that effect may take place by some chemical
action, which, like the instances already quoted, may change
quiescent into distributable heat. We have stated (See <a href="#GUNx"><i>Gunpowder</i></a>)
some instances of spontaneous combustion, which have
taken place merely in consequence of the charcoal. Some have
attributed the effect to pyrophorus, and others to the presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
of hydrogen in the coal, which, by absorbing and combining with
oxygen and forming water, sets the caloric of the oxygen gas at
liberty, and thus produces combustion. However this may be,
there are other instances, that of cotton and oil, some kinds of
wood, wood-ashes and oils, &amp;c. which have produced spontaneous
combustion.</p>

<p>We will only add, however, that until we can give a better
theory, the effect in these instances may be attributed to chemical
action, and <i>with it</i>, the change of caloric in the manner already
mentioned. Chemical action in such cases appears necessary,
although mechanical means, as percussion will produce heat.</p>

<p>Quiescent heat is also put in motion by electricity; but in what
manner it acts, so as to produce that effect, is unknown. It is a
powerful agent in nature, and calculated for important ends, of
which we are ignorant. It is unnecessary to notice opinions concerning
it. All electrics will yield it, such as glass, rosin, &amp;c.
and it may be collected in the usual manner by the prime conductor
and Leyden jar. Galvanism, called also Galvanic electricity,
produced by an arrangement of zinc, and copper plates in a pile,
or trough, and placed in contact with some oxygenizing fluid, has
the same effect of causing quiescent heat to become distributable,
and is undoubtedly the result of chemical action. The peculiar
character of this fluid, the nature of the two opposite poles, &amp;c.
have been, and continue to be, a subject of interest to the philosopher.
The <i>deflagrator</i> of professor Hare of Philadelphia is an
apparatus well calculated for many interesting experiments on
galvanism. To that gentleman, we are also indebted for the compound
blowpipe, which produces a very intense heat by the combustion
of hydrogen in contact with oxygen gas. Notwithstanding
professor Clark of England has laid claim to the apparatus, and
the use of hydrogen gas in this way, the merit of the discovery is
due to our learned and ingenious countryman.</p>

<p>Since heat is put in motion as a consequence of the increased
capacity of a body, and, by combining with a substance whose
capacity has been increased, becomes by degrees quiescent, according
to the respective capacities of bodies; cold is an effect,
which is occasioned by this change from a free to a combined or
quiescent state. The absorption of heat, necessary for the gene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>ration
of cold, if so we may consider it, takes place in every instance,
where that effect is observed. The heat of surrounding
bodies, in a distributable state, is now no longer characterised as
such; and the consequence is, therefore, that that particular sensation,
or effect follows.</p>

<p>Cold may be produced by saline mixtures, the salts for which
having their full quantum of the water of crystallization; and by
the evaporation of fluids, as water, alcohol and ether. In the one
case, that of the freezing mixtures, we have seen, that the effect is
produced by the <i>absorption</i> of heat; and with regard to the cold
produced by fluids, even in <i>vacuo</i>, (where the effect is more instantaneous),
the cause is attributable to evaporation; for the fluid
changes from a liquid to an aeriform state, and during this transition
robs the body, with which it was in contact, of a part of its
caloric, and thereby reduces its temperature. Artificial ice is
made on this principle.</p>

<p>The next subject with regard to heat, is the different modes in
which it tends to a state of rest. There are some facts in relation
to this subject worthy of notice; and particularly, that, in the
tendency of caloric to become quiescent, after having been put
in motion, bodies often increase in temperature. This tendency
to a state of rest is effected either by the conducting power of
bodies, or radiation. Heat radiates in all directions, and in quantities,
according to the experiments of Leslie, more or less variable,
which depend on the nature of the radiating surface. Hence
that power, which bodies possess, called the radiating power, varies
in different substances. Thus, the radiating power of lampblack
is 100, while gold, silver, copper, and tin plate are 12,
from which it appears that the metals distribute less heat by radiation.
That caloric obeys the same laws as light, is obvious
from Pictet's experiments with concave mirrors, where the calorific
rays move in the same order, the angle of incidence being
equal to the angle of reflection. It is also refracted; hence the
concentration of the solar rays in a focus by the burning glass.
Various experiments have been made with mirrors, and concave
reflectors. The effect of the former in destroying the fleet before
Syracuse, an experiment made by Archimedes, is a fact well authenticated
in history. Concave reflectors have inflamed gunpowder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
This subject, however, is noticed at large, when speaking
of mirrors as an incendiary in war.</p>

<p>That bodies conduct heat, and with different degrees of power,
so that some are called good and others bad conductors, is well
known. This property depends on the quantity of caloric, which
a body receives, before it changes its state. Metals are considered
good conductors, and glass, charcoal, feathers, &amp;c. bad conductors.
Hence bad conductors, as wool, &amp;c. preserve the temperature
of the body, or keep it <i>warm</i> in winter; and snow, for the same
reason, prevents the action of intense cold on the ground. Liquids
also conduct heat. Whether we consider caloric in this case
carried, or transported, as it is more properly defined, the fact
may be shown by several experiments. Ebullition, or boiling, is
a phenomenon, which depends on the increment of temperature;
for as water, for instance, receives caloric, until the thermometer
indicates 212 degrees, the boiling point, mere evaporation ensues;
but that temperature, under the usual pressure of the atmosphere,
causes the formation of bubbles at the bottom of the vessel,
as that part receives the degree of heat necessary for ebullition
before any other; and these bubbles, as they form, rise in succession,
and pass off in the state of steam, while the circumjacent
fluid takes its place, and the process continues till all is boiled
away. Water, when it passes off in the state of steam, which requires
a degree of heat equal to 212 degrees of Fahrenheit, receives
also 1000 degrees of non-distributable caloric, or latent
heat; and however singular the fact may appear, the wise Author
of Nature, it seems, has reserved a <i>store of caloric</i>, in this form,
ready to be put in requisition, when necessity demands it, in a
distributable shape.</p>

<p>Caloric, when in a state of rest, exists in different proportions,
and although the actual temperature may be the same, yet the
quantity of caloric in a quiescent state may be variable. There
are several experiments, which are adduced to illustrate this fact.
It results from experiment, that bodies receive heat according to
their several capacities for it; hence, when any number of bodies
are differently heated, the caloric, which becomes latent, does not
distribute itself in equal quantities, but in various proportions,
according, as we remarked, to their several capacities. Caloric,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>
therefore, in a state of rest, is in relative quantities; and as the
capacity of bodies for heat is variable, and relative as to each
other, the term <i>specific caloric</i> has been applied. From these
conclusions, we may readily perceive what is implied by an
equality of temperature. That it merely depends on the state of
rest, which caloric necessarily comes to, and which is relative as
respects the capacity of bodies, and nothing more, is a deduction
very plain and obvious. Heat, in a state of motion, may be said
to be progressing to a quiescent state; and equalization of temperature,
although differently understood, may be considered an
equalization of fixed caloric, according to the relative capacity of
bodies, without regarding the equalization, which takes place of
uncombined caloric, as is manifested by thermometrical instruments.
In a word, by considering caloric in this view, that of
tending to a state of rest, and uniting with bodies according to
their respective capacities, we may account for many phenomena;
as, for instance, the quantity of caloric which enters into ice, and
becomes latent, during liquefaction. The quantity of caloric, in
this respect, may be learnt by adding a pound of ice at 32 degrees
to a pound of water at 172 degrees. The temperature will
be much below 102 degrees, the arithmetical mean, viz. 32 degrees.
It is evident that the excess of caloric has disappeared;
and by deducting 32 degrees from 172 degrees, 140 degrees remain,
which is the quantity of caloric that enters into a pound
of ice during liquefaction, or the quantity required to raise a pound
of water from 32 degrees to 172 degrees. This change of capacity
appears to be absolutely essential to the well being of the universe,
as affording a constant modification of the action of heat
and cold, the effects of which would otherwise be inordinate. If
this did not take place, the whole of a mass of water, which was
exposed to a temperature above the boiling point, would be instantly
dissipated in vapour with explosion. The polar ice, would
all instantly dissolve, whenever the temperature of the circumambient
air was above 32 degrees, if it were not that each particle
absorbs a quantity of caloric in its solution, and thereby generates
a degree of cold which arrests and regulates the progress of
the thaw; and the converse of this takes place in congelation,
which is in its turn moderated by the heat developed in conse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>quence
of the diminution of capacity, which takes place in the
water during its transition to a solid state. The reason why boiling
water in the open air never reaches a higher temperature than
212 degrees is evident, if we consider, that the capacity of those
portions of liquid, which are successively resolved into a vapour,
becomes thereby sufficiently augmented to enable them to absorb
the superabundant caloric as fast as it is communicated.</p>

<p>The most obvious effect of caloric on bodies, is the change,
which they undergo when exposed to its action.</p>

<p>That it acts constantly in opposition to the attraction of cohesion
or of aggregation, by which bodies pass from a solid to a
fluid, and from a fluid to an aeriform state, and produces also different
changes in bodies,&mdash;are facts that come under our daily observation.</p>

<p>It occasions changes in the bulk of bodies; hence solids, liquids,
and gases are expanded. The expansion, and subsequent contraction
of atmospheric air, give rise to various winds, which are
currents of air rushing from one point of the compass to another
to maintain an equilibrium. The theory of the winds is predicated
on this fact, although some have asserted, that they depend
greatly on the diurnal motion of the earth. The air thermometer
of Sanctorius, and the differential thermometer of Leslie, are
founded on this principle, of the expansion of air. Fluids expand
until they arrive at the boiling point, as is the case with water,
alcohol, &amp;c. The expansion of mercury, in a glass tube, furnished
with a graduated scale, forms the mercurial thermometer, by the
rise and fall of which, the different variations of temperature are
marked.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding caloric has the property of expanding bodies,
there are some exceptions to this law, which may be proper to notice.
Water, for instance, at the temperature below 40° contracts
at every increment of temperature until it reaches 40°, which is
its maximum of density. Above 40° it expands, until it arrives at
the boiling point. Alumina, or pure argillaceous earth, also contracts
by heat; hence it is used in the pyrometer of Wedgwood, to
measure by its contraction intense degrees of heat. Various saline
substances, in the act of crystallization, also expand. Several of
the metals, when previously melted, on cooling exhibit the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
character; and water, in the act of freezing, exerts a powerful
force by its expansion, competent to the bursting of shells, and the
splitting of rocks.</p>

<p>The changes in bodies, produced by caloric, we have already
noticed. We will only add, that fluids require different temperatures,
called the boiling point, to make them boil, under the same
atmospheric pressure. Water boils at 212°. Many observations
have been made with respect to water, both in the state of ice, and
the state of vapour. Besides the accession of 212 degrees of caloric,
appreciable by the thermometer, in water in the state of steam,
there is also an accession of non-distributable caloric, called <i>latent
heat</i>, which is calculated at 1000°. In consequence of this circumstance,
steam has been judiciously applied to various useful purposes,
and particularly in a certain manner for the drying of gunpowder.</p>

<p>That chemical changes are produced by the agency of caloric,
is a fact well known. It is supposed to occasion decompositions,
according to the laws of affinity, by changing previous affinities,
and causing new affinities to take place. Hence the operations by
fire, whether the substances themselves are exposed in a dry state
to the action of heat, or otherwise, produce new results, or compounds,
which could not be made without it. This truth has long
been obvious. In consequence of a knowledge of this fact, Dr.
Black (<cite>Lectures</cite> vol. i, p. 12,) defined "chemistry to be the study
of the effects of heat and mixture, with the view of discovering
their general and subordinate laws, and of improving the useful
arts."</p>

<p>Caloric as a powerful auxiliary, performing as it does an innumerable
multitude of changes and effects, an agent by which the
operations of the universe are maintained in order and harmony
for universal good, exerts the same effect in the furnace of the
chemist, as in the great laboratory of nature; and regulates, and
determines all the consequences, which follow a succession of fixed,
and appointed changes.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span></p>

<p>We have thus, in this brief and hasty outline of the nature,
principal effects, and properties of caloric, detailed the leading
facts on this subject; from which it will be seen, that caloric, so
far as respects its generation by the combustion of different pyro-mixtures,
and effects, generally, should form a part of Pyrotechny,
and claim the attention of those, who are connected with the preparation
of Fire-Works.</p>

<p>Respiration is also a process which puts quiescent heat in motion.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>In the second part of the work, we embrace the furniture of a
laboratory, for the use of fire-workers, consisting of various tools
and utensils.</p>

<p>Under this head, we also embrace sundry manipulations, such
as the preparation of substances for use, the manner of forming
mixtures, and various anterior operations. The formation of pasteboard
for cases, the mode of forming as well as charging cases,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span>
different modes of charging rockets, the dimensions of rammers,
mallets &amp;c. This preliminary ought to be well understood; as the
successful practice of the art depends greatly on these operations.
We may observe, however, that we have had occasion to repeat
some of these manipulations in certain instances, to make them
more intelligible; or rather to present, more in connection with
the subject, a detail of minutiæ.</p>

<p>In the different compositions, the reader will bear in mind, that
the copious collection of formulæ, both old and new, embraces all
the facts, with which we are acquainted, concerning pyrotechnical
preparations.</p>

<p>In most instances, where the importance of the subject required
it, we designated, or set apart from the rest, formulæ, which have
been <i>approved</i>, and particularly in France.</p>

<p>This is more particularly the case as it respects the fourth and
last part, which appertains exclusively to Military Fire-Works.
On this subject, permit me to remark, that fire-works, intended for
the purposes of war, should be depended on; and for that reason,
in order to produce a certain effect, the materials of which they
are composed should be pure, weighed with accuracy in the proportions
required, and carefully mixed according to the rules laid
down. It is true, however, that while this nicety is required in
particular cases, it is unnecessary in the formation of all fire-works.
The composition for carcass and light-ball, for tourteaux,
links, and fascines, and some others, do not require that precision;
whereas the composition for fuses for bombs, howitzes, and grenades
should be in every respect accurately made; for on the accuracy
of the composition, must depend the time a fuse will burn,
which is afterwards regulated by using more or less of the fuse, according
to the time it will take for the shell to reach its destination,
on which depends the skill of the bombardier. Accuracy,
however, in making of preparations should be a general rule.</p>

<p>Viewing Pyrotechny either as a science or an art, there is undoubtedly
required in its prosecution much skill and practice. A
knowledge of the theory of fire-works may be readily acquired.
The mere artificer or fire-worker, by constant habit and experience,
may understand it is true how to mix materials, prepare
compositions, charge cases, and perform all other mechanical ope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span>rations;
but it is equally certain, that, without a knowledge of chemistry,
he cannot understand the theory. We would not say, that
the workman should be a chemist, but that he should know enough
to determine the purity of the substances he employs, and their
respective qualities and effects; for if that principle were admitted,
we might go further and say, that every person, who practices a
chemical art, as the tanner, gluemaker, brazier, &amp;c. should be a
chemist, or that the art could not be conducted without a previous
knowledge of chemistry, which we know is contrary to fact. This,
however, may be said, that in <i>all</i> arts which are decidedly chemical,
as that of <i>dying</i> for instance, chemical knowledge will enable
the artist or operator to conduct his processes with better advantage,
and correct any <i>old</i> routine, which is too often pursued, because
it was handed down from generation to generation. Mr.
Seguin in France facilitated the preparation of tanned leather, by
adopting a new process altogether chemical. In a word, so far as
chemistry is connected with the arts, and by which we explain
the operations that take place, it is undoubtedly important; and
with regard to Pyrotechny, it appears, in the way we have mentioned,
to be <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'indispensible'">indispensable</ins>. Chaptal (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Elements de Chimie</cite>) observes,
that the works of artificers frequently miscarry in consequence of
their being unacquainted with the art.</p>

<p>In noticing this subject, we may be permitted to digress, while
we state, that, being fully convinced of this truth, we have directed
our labours in the Chemical Department of the United States'
Military Academy to two distinct objects; <i>viz.</i> to theoretical and
experimental chemistry, forming the first year's course, and chemistry
in its application to the arts, manufactures, and domestic
economy, constituting, along with mineralogy, the course of the
second year. In addition to the usual applications, Pyrotechny, in
the manner we have stated, and especially that branch which treats
of military fire-works, has claimed our attention; and we have reason
to believe, that this addition, to the usual course of chemical
instruction, has considerably advanced the utility, especially to
gentlemen designed for the army, of the application of chemistry.</p>

<p>The system of instruction adopted throughout the academy, in
the different departments, (the plan of which may be seen in the
new <cite>Army Regulations</cite>, article Military Academy), which, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>
have no hesitation in believing, is the most complete of any in
the United States, and by far the most extensive,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> is so regulated,
that each section of a class regularly recite, and are interrogated
on each subject of instruction, so that, while an emulation to excel
is thus excited, the comparative merit or standing of the cadets is
thereby determined. Adopting the same system in the Chemical
department, that of interrogation on the subject of the preceding
lecture, has many peculiar advantages; so that, while the mind
and memory of the pupil are thus exercised, a comparative estimate
of the progress of each one is obtained during each week,
by which we are enabled, as in other departments, to present a
Weekly Class Report of their progress.</p>

<p>While we are indebted to the talents and industry of the professors
and teachers of the Academy, for the flourishing condition
it is now in, and the progress of the cadets in every branch there
taught; it is but justice to remark, that for the present organization
of the academy, as relates to the studies, which is obviously
preferable to the old system, and also for the improvements in
instruction, we are indebted to the present superintendent, Col. S.
Thayer, of the U. S. corps of engineers.</p>

<p>Considering pyrotechny, abstract from the questions usually
given, and forming a distinct branch, it may be proper to remark,
that the interrogatories on this head have been minutely and satisfactorily
answered. The following outline will exhibit the order in
which such questions were put, observing, however, that they are
merely in connection with this subject:</p>

<p>What is saltpetre? What is nitric acid? What is potash? What
are the sources of saltpetre, and how is it obtained? How is it
formed in nitre beds, extracted, and refined? What circumstances
are necessary to produce nitre, and how does animal matter
act in its production? What is the difference between the old and
new process for refining saltpetre? What reagents are used to
discover the presence of foreign substances in nitre? What are
nitre caves? Where do they exist? What are the nitre caves of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span>
Western country, and how is nitre extracted from the earth?
What proportion of nitre does the saltpetre earth of the nitre
caves afford? What is the theory of the process for extracting saltpetre
from nitrous earth, or nitrate of lime? What is sulphur?
How is it obtained, and how is it purified for the manufacture of
gunpowder? Of what use is sulphur in the composition of gunpowder?
Does it add to the effective force of gunpowder? What
is charcoal? What is the best mode of carbonizing wood for the
purpose of gunpowder? What woods are preferred for this purpose?
In the charring of wood, what part is converted into coal,
and what gas and acid are disengaged? What is the use of charcoal
in gunpowder? What is gunpowder? What are considered
the best proportions for forming it, and what constitutes the difference
between powder for war, for gunning, and for mining? How
does the combustion of gunpowder take place? Can you explain
why combustion takes place without the presence of a gaseous
supporter of combustion, as gunpowder will inflame in vacuo?
What are the products of the combustion of gunpowder? What
gases are generated? To what is the force of fired gunpowder
owing? What are the experiments of Mr. Robins on the force of
gunpowder? How would you separate the component parts of gunpowder,
so as to determine their proportions? What are gunpowder
proofs? What is understood by the comparative force of gunpowder?
What are eprouvettes? &amp;c. In noticing in the same
manner the preparations used for fire-works, and for war, as the
rocket for instance, the following questions were propounded; <i>viz.</i>
What is a rocket? How is it formed? Is the case always made
of paper? What is the war rocket? What is the composition for
rockets, and how does it act? What particular care is required
in charging a rocket? What is the cause of the ascension of rockets?
What is the use of the conical cavity, made in a rocket at
the time it is charged, or bored out after it is charged? How do
cases charged with composition impart motion to wheels, and
other pieces of fire-work? What is understood by the rocket principle?
What is the rocket stick, and its use? Is the centre of
gravity fixed, or is it shifting in the flight of rockets? How are
rockets discharged? What is the head of a rocket? What is
usually put in the head? Are all rockets furnished with a head?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span>
What is understood by the furniture of a rocket? How are the
serpents, stars, fire-rain, &amp;c. forming the furniture of a rocket,
discharged into the air, when the rocket has terminated its flight,
or arrived at its maximum of ascension? What forms the difference
between a balloon, in fire-works, and a rocket? As the balloon
contains also furniture, and is projected vertically from a
mortar, how is fire communicated to it, so as to burst it in the air?
Is the fuse used, in this case the same as that for bombs, howitzes,
and grenades? What is the Asiatic rocket? The fougette of the
French? In what seige were they employed with success by the
native troops of India? What was the nature of their war-rocket?
What is the murdering rocket of the French? Is the conical head
hollow, or solid, blunt or pointed? Why is it called the murdering
rocket? What is the Congreve rocket? Is Congreve the inventor,
or improver of this rocket? What are Congreve rockets
loaded or armed with? In what part is the load placed? Is the
case made of paper or sheet iron? What are the sizes of Congreve
rockets?</p>

<p>What are the ranges of Congreve rockets? What angle of
elevation produces the best range? How are Congreve rockets
discharged in the field, and what number of men are usually employed
for that service? Are the Congreve rockets considered to
be a powerful offensive weapon; and, if so, in what particular?
What is a carcass rocket? As an incendiary, is the carcass rocket
equal to the usual carcass thrown from mortars? What is the carcass
composition made of? What is the Congreve rocket light ball? In
large rockets, are their sticks solid, or bored and filled with gunpowder?
Why is that expedient used? &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is obvious, that the student, after obtaining a knowledge of
each subject by the preceding lecture, accompanied with demonstrations,
is enabled to detail minutely all the facts in relation to
it.</p>

<p>Pyrotechny, as known at present, is confined to a few books,
and scattered in a desultory manner, without any regular or connected
system. In fact the works which treat on this subject are
in French, or translations from the French on particular subjects,
but generally very imperfect. As applied to the uses of war, we
may indeed say, that the small treatise of Bigot, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité d'Artifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</a></span>
de Guerre</cite>), and Ruggeri (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pyrotechnie Militaire</cite>) are the only
works. We have, therefore, consulted these authors, as will be
seen in the pages of the work.</p>

<p>Roger Bacon, in his <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Opus Majus</cite>, has given some account of the
Greek fire, and of a composition, which seems to have had the effect
of our modern gunpowder.</p>

<p>Malthus (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de l'Artillerie</cite>) contains some formulæ for
Military Fire-Works. Anzelet and Vanorchis, in their several
works, have given some receipts for incendiary preparations. Henzion
(<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Recreations Mathématiques</cite>) and Joachim Butelius have also
something on the subject.</p>

<p>The celebrated Polander, Casimir Siemienowicz, has nothing
of any moment, if we except the incendiary fire-rain, an account
of which may be seen in the fourth part of our work. His book is
considered, however, the best of the whole of them. Belidor, Theodore
Duturbrie, &amp;c. have mentioned some preparations; but their
works are chiefly confined to artillery.</p>

<p>The improvement of Pyrotechny is ascribed to the Germans
and Italians, and the French acknowledge, that they are indebted
for a knowledge of it to the Italians. Be this as it may, it is certain,
that it was known in China from time immemorial. Their acquaintance
with gunpowder, before it was known in Europe, is a
fact which appears to be generally admitted. For an account of
the Chinese fire-works, and the origin of gunpowder in Europe,
consult these articles respectively.</p>

<p>Whatever merit we may claim in this work, as the public will
be able to judge impartially, it will be seen, by referring to the different
chapters and sections, that we have endeavoured to form a
system, by presenting a connected view of the whole subject.</p>

<p>Having noticed under separate heads, the particular use and application
of each composition, we have added a chapter on the arrangement
of fire-works for exhibition, together with the order to
be observed. We may remark here, that we have enlarged in this
part more perhaps than its merit or importance deserves; but, on
reflection, we thought it better to embrace the whole subject, in
order to form a more complete system in all its parts.</p>

<p>After going through the fire-works for exhibition, and noticing
the different formulæ, and preparations, for arrangement, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span>
theory of effects, we consider, in the next place, a subject of more
importance, that of Military Pyrotechny. We have adopted this
arrangement, more on account of obtaining a better acquaintance
with ordinary fire-works, before the reader is prepared for military
works, which he will understand with more facility; for all the
preliminary operations precede the practical part.</p>

<p>On this head, it will be sufficient to add, to what we have already
stated, that we have given in each article, generally speaking,
a variety of formulæ, with ample instructions for the preparation
of each composition. The table of contents will exhibit
the order in which they are treated.</p>

<p>In noticing the substances used in fire-works, in the first part,
it will be perceived, that we have noticed some of them more extensively
according to their importance; as for instance, <i>saltpetre</i>.
Besides the different modes of obtaining saltpetre in Europe and
elsewhere, and the means employed for refining it, we mention the
saltpetre caves of the western country, which furnish an abundance
of this article, and which contain an almost inexhaustible supply.</p>

<p>The extraction of saltpetre from the earth, (principally nitrate
of lime), by using a lixivium of wood-ashes; the formation of rough,
and subsequently of refined nitre; the various methods of refining
saltpetre, and particularly that adopted in France; with sundry
facts respecting the origin of nitre, and on the formation of artificial
nitre beds; all claim our particular notice.</p>

<p>The extraction of sulphur from its combinations, and the means
used for purifying it for the purpose of gunpowder, are also considered
in the same manner.</p>

<p>The subject of charcoal, an essential constituent of gunpowder,
claims, in like manner, particular attention. The various modes
of charring, the woods employed, the quantity of coal obtained,
the formation of pyroacetic acid in the process of carbonization,
and many facts of the same kind are considered. These subjects,
<i>viz.</i> nitre, charcoal, and sulphur, are highly important to the manufacturer
of gunpowder.</p>

<p>A <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'knowlege'">knowledge</ins> of the various processes for refining saltpetre; the
best and most approved modes of carbonizing wood; the purification
and quality of sulphur; the different processes for making
gunpowder, with the proportion of the ingredients used in France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[xli]</a></span>
and elsewhere; the granulation, glazing, and drying of powder, the
use of the steam apparatus, and the different modes of proving it,
and of examining it chemically; and the means of ascertaining the
purity of nitre in any specimen of gunpowder; are, with others,
subjects of particular interest to the gunpowder manufacturer.</p>

<p>With respect to the Theory of the explosion of gunpowder,
we have noticed it at some length, and have added the experiments
and observations of Mr. Robins, and of other persons, made
at different periods.</p>

<p>In the consideration of the gaseous products, and the caloric
evolved by the combustion of powder, we have taken a view of
the gases produced, the cause of their production, the dilatation
which they suffer, and the experiments of Lavoisier and Laplace,
with regard to latent heat, and deducing therefrom some views of
the probable cause of the production of caloric in fired gunpowder.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[xlii]</a></span></p>

<p>Our observations respecting rockets, the theory of their ascension,
of the Congreve carcass and Asiatic rockets, and some others,
are we apprehend sufficiently extensive. As it regards the different
incendiary compositions, and their use in war, the reader will
find ample instructions on these heads.</p>

<p>We may also remark, that we have given some of the more common,
or general properties of the substances, employed in the
composition of fire-works, without going into that detail, which
belongs exclusively to works that treat of Chemistry. It was neither
our design, nor have we given, for the reasons thus stated, <i>all</i>
the chemical characters or properties of the substances so employed;
and, therefore, have confined ourselves, generally speaking, to
an enumeration of such properties as are connected with the subject,
or are indispensably necessary to be known, before a rationale
of the causes and effects can be understood.</p>

<p>It was our intention to accompany the work with plates, exhibiting
the arrangement, &amp;c. of fire-works, which, there can be
no doubt, would have facilitated in particular the knowledge of
forming, and arranging, certain pieces of fire-work; but, on
second reflection, as such illustrations were connected more with
fancy exhibitions, and have little or no relation to Military Fire-works,
the most useful branch of Pyrotechny, we were finally
of opinion, that the addition of plates would greatly enhance the
price, without advancing or adding to the value of the work.</p>

<p>If, however, a second edition should be required, various figures
in illustration of particular subjects may be added, either with a distinct
explanatory chapter, or a reference from the articles themselves,
with the necessary explanation, to the figures respectively.</p>

<p>It would require at least twenty-five plates to include all the
figures we originally intended to have introduced.</p>

<p>Before concluding this introduction, it remains for us to remark,
that, in forming this work, we consulted a variety of authors, but
with little advantage, except some French works, which we shall
notice. Chaptal (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chimie Appliqué aux Arts</cite>;) Bigot (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Artifice de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[xliii]</a></span>

<p>We examined various authors in English; and with regard to
the origin of inventions, we found the learned, and valuable work
of professor Beckman (<cite>History of Inventions</cite>) very useful, and
likewise James's <cite>Military Dictionary</cite>. To the <cite>Encyclopedia Britannica</cite>,
we are indebted for many interesting facts, and some extracts
on fire-works for exhibition.</p>

<p>On the subject of mining, we consulted the <cite>Treatise on mines
for the use of the Royal Military Academy</cite>, by Landmann.</p>

<p>We deem it necessary to observe, that, in collecting our formulæ
for military fire-works, although we have sometimes extracted
from the Strasbourg <cite>Memoir</cite>, the <cite>Bombardier and Pocket Gunner</cite>,
and the <cite>Military Dictionary</cite> of Duane and James, we have generally
followed Bigot; as the formulæ which he gives for the preparation
of Military fire-works have been approved by the French
government; and where any thing of importance occurred in Ruggeri,
we have, for the same reason, extracted such formulæ from
that author.</p>

<p>As respects the turtle, torpedo, and catamarin, submarine machines,
it appears that Bushnel (<cite>Trans. Am. Phil. Soc.</cite>) claims
the originality of the discovery from the date of his invention, although
similar contrivances had long ago been suggested. Fulton's
improvements, in the torpedo, are deserving of particular attention;
but it is plain, that the Catamarin of the English is the same
in principle and application as Fulton's torpedo, and that Fulton
deserves the merit of it. Congreve, if we believe Ruggeri, was not
the inventor of the rocket, which bears his name; for, according to
him, it was invented about the year 1798 by a naval officer at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[xliv]</a></span>
Bourdeaux. It is certain, however, it was neither much known,
nor used before the attack on Copenhagen.</p>

<p>It is certain that the present incendiary fire-stone was taken
from the recipe for fire-rain contained in the military work of
Cassimir <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Siemienowick'">Siemienowicz</ins>, or that the fire-rain gave rise to a similar
preparation. The idea of the <i>pyrophore</i>, mentioned in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives
des Découvertes</cite>, must have originated from the use of the
powder-barrel, and of similar means of defence. We might enumerate
many other inventions, which owe their origin in the same
way.</p>

<p class="center">PYROTECHNY IN GENERAL.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. I. Definition of Pyrotechny.</i></p>

<p>Pyrotechny is defined the doctrine of artificial fire-works,
whether for war or exhibition, and is derived from the
Greek, <span title="pyr">πυρ</span> <i>fire</i>, and <span title="technê">τεχνη</span> <i>art</i>. In a more general sense, it comprehends
the structure and use of fire-arms, and the science
which teaches the management and application of fire in several
operations.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="GENx" id="GENx"></a><i>Sec. II. General theory of Pyrotechny.</i></p>

<p>In the composition of artificial fire, various substances are
employed, having different properties, and designed to produce
certain effects characterised by particular phenomena.
These substances are either inflammable, or support the combustion
of inflammable bodies. As pyrotechnical mixtures
are differently formed, and of various substances, the effects
are also modified, although combustion, under some shape
always takes place.</p>

<p>Combustion is either modified, retarded, or accelerated;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and in consequence of the presence of certain substances, different
appearances are given to flame.</p>

<p>The conditions necessary for combustion are, the presence
of a combustible substance, of a supporter of combustion, and
a certain temperature. Thus, charcoal when raised to the
temperature of 800° in the open air, takes fire. This elevation
of temperature enables it to act chemically on the oxygen
gas of the atmosphere; the latter, as it comes in contact,
being decomposed. Now, as oxygen gas is a combination of
oxygen and caloric, the caloric being in a latent state, the
charcoal unites with the oxygen, and the phenomena of combustion
ensue; that is, an evolution of <i>heat</i> and <i>light</i>. The
caloric of the decomposed gas is given out in a free state,
and, according to the theory of Dr. Thomson, (<cite>Thomson's
System of Chemistry</cite>, vol. i.) the light proceeds from the
burning body. We have then an instance of combustion, in
which there is a combustible, a supporter of combustion, and
an elevated temperature. The old theory of combustion, called
the <i>Stahlian</i> theory, which presupposes an element called
phlogiston, or a principle of fire, to exist in all bodies under
some modification, would explain these effects by merely supposing,
that combustion was nothing more than a disengagement
of phlogiston; and that when a body had lost its inflammable
principle, (as a metal, when oxidized), it became dephlogisticated.
But, as it proved that phlogiston is a hypothetical
element, and the anti-phlogistic doctrine clearly
shows, that combustion is no other than a process which unites
the supporter with the combustible, forming new products;
it follows, that, in all changes of the kind, the same reasoning
will apply, and the same principle be tenable.</p>

<p>The products of combustion depend on the nature of the
substance burnt, and the supporter employed. Thus, in the
instance just mentioned, the charcoal, by its union with oxygen,
is changed into carbonic acid, which takes the gaseous
state. We say then, that carbonic acid is the product of the
combustion of charcoal, or, chemically speaking, of carbon.
As resins, oil, &amp;c. contain hydrogen, as well as carbon, the
products in such cases would be water, as well as carbonic
acid.</p>

<p>The chemical effects, therefore, which we consider in fire-works,
forming the basis on which a theory of sundry phenomena
may be formed, are no other than the result of the
action of one body on another, according to the laws which
govern such action, and the consequent operation of chemical
combination. Combustion, in fire-works, may be con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>sidered
a primary agent in <i>all effects</i> which characterise artificial
fire.</p>

<p>The second change, with respect to the appearance of the
flame, the formation of stars, serpents, rain, &amp;c. terms used
in the art, is owing either to new chemical changes which
the substances undergo, or to the decomposition of the products
themselves. These effects, it is obvious, must be governed
by the circumstances, under which the mixtures are
made. Saltpetre, for instance, is the basis of fire-works,
whether used in a separate state, or employed in mixture
with charcoal and sulphur, as in gun-powder; and, from its
composition, is adapted to all the purposes of the art, because
it yields its oxygen very readily to all inflammable bodies.
In consequence of the decomposition, it undergoes at an elevated
temperature, when brought in contact with charcoal,
sulphur, &amp;c. and various substances which contain carbon, as
pitch, rosin, turpentine, tallow, copal, and amber, combustion
results, and, according to circumstances, is more or less
rapid, and the flame also more or less brilliant.</p>

<p>When charcoal, in the state of ignition, is brought in contact
with nitre, a deflagration takes place, because, at the
temperature of ignition, it has the property of decomposing
the nitric acid of the nitre; and as this process unites the
carbon with the oxygen, in the proportion necessary to constitute
carbonic acid, this acid is accordingly produced. When,
therefore, we inflame a mixture of nitre, charcoal, and sulphur,
or gun-powder, the whole or greater part disappears;
and if we were to collect in a pneumatic apparatus, the products
of the combustion, it would be found, that they are
nearly altogether gaseous, and composed, as we shall speak
hereafter, of sundry elastic aëriform fluids. This decomposition,
the immediate effect of the charcoal on the nitric
acid of the nitre, is the same as in the preceding instance,
for carbonic acid gas is formed in both cases. We have
then another instance of combustion, where a number of substances
are concerned, and therefore, the products must be
numerous.</p>

<p>We notice this subject more particularly, since, as in the
different fire-works, nitre and inflammable bodies are used
in different proportions, the result is always affected by the
same laws of chemical decomposition; for the same substances,
placed under similar circumstances of proportion, mixture,
&amp;c. afford the like results. If carbon alone be employed,
carbonic acid gas is the result; if oil, tallow, rosin, or turpentine
be used, we have then, as we had occasion to remark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
water, as well as carbonic acid, by reason of the union of
the hydrogen, which forms one of their constituent parts,
with a part of the oxygen of the nitric acid.</p>

<p>Again, in a composition of mealed powder, rosin and sulphur,
with or without the addition of saw dust, we infer, from
the composition of the ingredients and the chemical action
which subsequently takes place, that the products of combustion
would be carbonic acid gas, sulphurous acid gas, water,
sulphuretted hydrogen, and probably azotic, and nitric oxide
gases. If the filings of steel, brass, zinc, or copper, enter into
the composition, besides the products above-mentioned, there
would be either an oxide of iron, an oxide of zinc, or, an
oxide of copper, according as one or other of these metals
are employed.</p>

<p>Copper, in fire-works, has the effect of communicating a
green colour to the flame. M. Homberg, (<cite>Collection Acad.</cite>)
observes, that the green colour in such cases is owing to the
<i>dissolution</i> of the metal, which in fact is nothing more than
the <i>effect</i> of its oxidizement.</p>

<p>The various compositions for brilliant fire, as the Chinese
fire, owe their peculiar character to pulverised cast iron, and
commonly to steel and iron filings. Now the effects in these
cases are the same; for the same oxidizement ensues, more
or less rapidly, which in fact distinguishes the kinds of
brilliant fire. That of the Chinese is the most perfect, and
next is the composition made with steel filings. It will
be seen, however, that compositions generally are governed,
in their respective appearances when inflamed, by the purity,
as well as the proportion of other substances, which enter
into them; and hence much of their effect depends on collateral
circumstances, which we purpose to consider when we
treat of the compositions individually.</p>

<p>That the light of certain burning bodies may be increased,
is evident from these facts; and experiment has shown, that
the intensity of the light of burning sulphur, hydrogen, carbonic
oxide, &amp;c. is increased by throwing into them, zinc,
or its oxide, iron, and other metals, or by placing in them
very fine amianthus or metallic gauze. Protochloride of
copper burns with a dense red light, tinged with green and
blue towards the edges. If the hydrogen of the oil acts in
separating the chlorine from the copper, and the reduced
copper is ignited by the charcoal, this appearance must necessarily
ensue.</p>

<p>When solid matter is the product of combustion, as in the
burning of phosphorus, zinc, iron, &amp;c. the flame is remark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>ed
to be more intense. Flame may be modified under
other circumstances, as we will have occasion to mention
hereafter. When, for instance, a wire-gauze safety-lamp is
made to burn in a very explosive mixture of coal gas and
air, the light is very feeble and of a pale colour; but when
a current of coal gas is burnt in atmospheric air, the combustion
is rapid and the flame brilliant.</p>

<p>Dr. Ure thinks it probable, (<cite>Dictionary of Chemistry</cite>,
article combustion,) that, when the colour of the flame is
changed by the introduction of incombustible compounds,
the effect depends on the production, and subsequent ignition
or combustion of inflammable matter from them.
Thus he infers, that the rose-coloured light given to flame
by the compounds of strontium and calcium, and the yellow
colour given by those of barium, and the green by
those of boron, may depend upon a temporary production of
these bases, by the inflammable matter of the flame. It is inferred
also, as a probable conclusion, that the heat of flames may
be actually diminished by increasing their light, (at least the
heat communicable to other matter), and <i>vice versa</i>; because,
in the most intense heat, as in the compound blow pipe, or
in Newman's blow pipe apparatus, in which a mixture of oxygen
and hydrogen gases is compressed, the flame, although
hardly visible in bright day light, instantly fuses the most
refractory bodies; but the light of solid bodies ignited in it,
is so vivid as to be painful to the eye.</p>

<p>Some curious facts with regard to flame, in connection
with electricity, are given by Brande in the Phil. Trans.
for 1814. He supposes that some chemical bodies are
naturally in the resinous, and others in the positive electrical
state. He supposes also, as a consequence, that the positive
flame will be attracted, and neutralize the negative polarity,
while the negative flame will operate a similar change by
inducing an equilibrium at the positive pole. Thus he found,
that certain flames were attracted by the positive ball of
an electrical apparatus, and others attracted by the negative
ball. The flame of sulphur and phosphorus is attracted
by the positive pole, and the flame of camphor, resins, and
hydrogen by the negative pole.</p>

<p>In relation to the production of flame, we may observe,
that, as sundry solid and fluid substances are inflammable,
the products of combustion depend on the composition of
the substance made use of, and the condition under which it
is burnt. As to gaseous substances that are inflammable,
the base of some gases, we may remark, as carbon and hydro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>gen,
unite in the process of combustion with the base of
other gases, (as oxygen;) and in other instances, the <i>gas</i> itself
takes fire, and exhibits the phenomena of flame. Now carbonic
acid gas extinguishes flame, although its base is inflammable;
but hydrogen, as well as hydrogen gas, is inflammable,
and when burnt in oxygen gas or atmospheric air produces
water, which also extinguishes the flame of burning bodies.</p>

<p>As we will have occasion to notice a variety of aëriform
fluids, especially when we treat of the aëriform products of
fired gun-powder, a few remarks on this head may be useful
at this time.</p>

<p>By the combustion of bodies, substances are generated that
are either gaseous or solid, whence arises the variety of products.
Of aëriform fluids, some are coloured, as nitrous
acid vapour, (nitrous gas and oxygen), chlorine, and the
protoxide and deutoxide of chlorine. The first is red,
the rest yellowish-green, or yellowish. Some relight a taper,
provided the wick remain ignited, as oxygen gas, protoxide
of azote, and the oxides of chlorine. Others produce
<i>white vapours</i> in the air, as muriatic acid, fluoboric, fluosilicic,
and hydriodic. The inflammable gases, which take fire in
the air by contact of the lighted taper, are hydrogen, hydroguret,
and bihydroguret of carbon, carbonic oxide, prussine
or cyanogen, called also carburet of azote, and phosphuretted,
sulphuretted, arsenuretted, telluretted, and potassuretted
hydrogen. Other gases are acid, and redden litmus,
which, for that reason, are called acid gases, such as nitrous,
sulphurous, muriatic, fluoboric, hydriodic, fluosilicic, chlorocarbonic,
and carbonic acids; the oxides of chlorine, sulphuretted
hydrogen, telluretted hydrogen, and carburet of
azote. Some gases are destitute of smell, as oxygen, azote
and its protoxide, and carbonic acid; while others have a
strong and characteristic odour, as ammoniacal gas. Some
gases are very soluble in water, and others but slightly soluble,
such as fluoric, fluosilicic, carbonic, sulphurous, and
muriatic acids, and ammoniacal gas. Alkaline solutions absorb
some gases, as nitrous, sulphurous, muriatic, fluoboric, carbonic,
hydriodic, fluosilicic, chlorine, chlorocarbonic, and the
two oxides of chlorine, sulphuretted hydrogen, telluretted
hydrogen, and ammonia. Alkaline gases are ammonia, and
potassuretted hydrogen.</p>

<p>The character of gases is well defined. The compound
gas of phosphorus and hydrogen takes fire spontaneously in
the atmosphere, burning with a brilliant white flame; but
there is another gas formed of the same substances, that does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
not inflame spontaneously, but is inflammable, called subphosphuretted
hydrogen. This gas has a strong smell of
garlic or phosphorus, and is luminous in the dark. It may
be this peculiar combination, which gives rise to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignes
fatui</i>; but the permanent ignes fatui, observed in volcanic
countries, are said to be the slow combustion of sulphur,
forming sulphurous acid gas. Sir H. Davy found, that phosphuretted
hydrogen produced a flash of light when admitted
into the best vacuum that could be made by an excellent
pump of Nairn's construction.</p>

<p>Naphtha in contact with red hot iron glows with a lambent
flame at a rarefaction of thirty times, though its flame ceases
at an atmospheric rarefaction of six. Camphor ceases to
burn in an air rarefied six times, but, in a glass tube which
becomes ignited, the flame of camphor exists under ninefold
rarefaction; whereas phosphorus, according to the experiments
of Van Marum, will burn, although the atmosphere
be rarefied sixty times. Hydrogen gas will burn in a rarefied
air, when it is four or five times less than the pressure of the
atmosphere, and its flame be extinguished, when the pressure
is between seven and eight times less; from which it is inferred,
that the flame is extinguished in rarefied atmospheres,
only when the heat it produces is insufficient to keep up the
combustion. Olefiant gas (hydroguret of carbon) ceased
to burn in an atmosphere, where its pressure was diminished
between ten and eleven times. The flames of alcohol and of
wax taper were extinguished in an atmosphere, where pressure
was five or six times less without the wire of platinum,
and seven or eight times less when the wire was kept in the
flame. See <a href="#FLAx"><i>Flameless Lamp</i></a>. Several interesting conclusions
may be drawn from these facts, which, to enumerate,
would lead us beyond our design. It will be sufficient, therefore,
to add, that although a supporter of combustion is necessary
for that process, and flame may be differently modified,
yet combustion ceases if the pressure of the atmosphere
be diminished in certain ratios, as already noticed.</p>

<p>Besides nitre, other saline substances which contain oxygen
feebly combined, have been used for the same purpose.
Some years ago, it was proposed to substitute the hyper-oxymuriate,
now called chlorate of potassa, for nitre in the
formation of gun-powder. As chlorate of potassa, when
mixed with sulphur, &amp;c. produces combustion by percussion,
or by the contact of fire, this effect is attributed to the
same cause,&mdash;the separation of oxygen, not from azote, but
from the chlorine of the chloric acid, Hence, when that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
salt is used in fire-works, the result of the combustion is
similar to that in which nitre is employed; at least as regards
the union of the oxygen with the elementary principles of
the inflammable body. On this subject, we shall make some
remarks hereafter. Nitrate of soda, a salt which contains
nitric acid, and similar to saltpetre in that particular, has
been recommended also for fire-works. It has, however,
several objections. Our object in noticing it at this time is
to remark, that, when it is so employed, its effect is the
same as nitrate of potassa, or saltpetre, by furnishing oxygen
as the supporter of combustion. See <a href="#NITx"><i>Nitrate of Soda</i></a>.</p>

<p>We are of opinion, that many of the nitrates might be
advantageously employed in the manufacture of fire-works.
Some, as nitrate of strontian, communicate a red colour to
flame, as the flame of alcohol. Nitrate of lime also might
be used.</p>

<p>All nitrates, as well as the different hyperoxymuriates, or
chlorates, contain oxygen as an essential ingredient in the
acid of their respective salts, which is readily given up to
inflammable substances.</p>

<p>When nitrates are employed for fire-works, they should be
free from moisture, or water of crystallization, unless otherwise
required. The presence of water may, in many cases,
prove injurious to the composition; and, consequently, the
effect in those instances, may be influenced by this circumstance.
The composition of nitric acid, and the action of
carbon in the decomposition of the nitrates, or salts formed
by the union of nitric acid with sundry bases, will claim our
attention in the article on gun-powder.</p>

<p>With respect to the production of colours, some remarks
on this subject may be here added.</p>

<p>Speaking of colours, Haüy (<cite>Elementary Treatise of Natural
Philosophy</cite>, trans. ii. p. 253.) takes into view their formation
according to the Newtonian doctrine; and in a note
by the translator, several instances are given of the change
of colour by oxidizement and other processes. Iron when
exposed to heat in contact with atmospheric air gradually
absorbs oxygen, and changes its colour. The colours produced
depend entirely on the quantity of oxygen, and on
the absorption of some of the rays of light, and the reflection
of others. See <a href="#IROx"><i>Iron</i></a>. The tempering of steel instruments
depends on this property, and also the blueing of sword
blades, and many similar operations. The first impression
of fire usually developes a blue colour; a second degree produces
a yellow; and, if the oxidizement augments, the iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
becomes red. The major part of the metals present similar
phenomena.</p>

<p>In vegetables, the blue colour is formed by fermentation;
and many of these colours are susceptible of passing to
red by a greater quantity of oxygen, as they depend on the
absorption of oxygen. It is thus that the green fecula of
indigo becomes blue; turnsol, red by air and acids; and the
protoferrocyanate of iron, blue when exposed to the air.</p>

<p>When meat putrefies, the first degree of oxygenation decides
the blue colour; the red soon succeeds as the process
goes on. It would seem that the maximum of oxidation
determines the reflection of rays of every kind, in the same
proportions as subsist in solar light, of which we have many
instances in combustion.</p>

<p>The flame of burning bodies exhibits the same phenomena.
It is blue when the combination of oxygen is slow; red when
it is stronger, and white when the oxygenation is complete.</p>

<p>These facts lead to the conclusion, that the combination
of oxygen, and its proportions, give birth in bodies to the
property of reflecting corresponding rays of light; but, since
the combination of oxygen in different proportions ought to
change the thickness and density of the component laminæ,
and, consequently, to produce variations in the colours, this
doctrine is not easily reconciled with the received theory.</p>

<p>By considering the temperature necessary to inflame different
bodies; the nature of flame, and the relation between
light and heat, which compose it; the caloric disengaged
in a free state during the combustion of bodies, and the
causes, which modify the appearance of flame,&mdash;we may be
enabled to account for the phenomena already noticed. Thus,
phosphorus at 150°, and sulphur at 550°, are said to take
fire, and two acid products are formed; at 800°, hydrogen
gas explodes with oxygen, and produces water; and, according
to Ure's view, the flame of combustible bodies may in
all cases be considered as the combustion of an <i>explosive
mixture</i> of inflammable gas, or vapour, with air; and as to
the change of quiescent into distributable heat, and the causes
that modify combustion and flame, the facts on these heads
are numerous and very important.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. III. Remarks on the Nature of particular Compositions.</i></p>

<p>The <i>spur fire</i>, which was invented by the Chinese, but
brought to perfection in Europe, is remarkably beautiful
when employed in some particular parts of fire-works. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
fire was so named from the effect it produces, that of forming
scintillations, resembling a shower, or drops of rain, or the
rowel of a spur. The <i>artificial flower pot</i> is formed of this
fire. The <i>stars</i> and <i>pinks</i>, which it produces, are said to be
brilliant. The composition of spur fire being saltpetre, lampblack,
and sulphur, in the proportions we shall give hereafter,
is similar in fact to that of gunpowder; for the lampblack
acts in the same manner as common charcoal. As the lampblack,
however, is extremely fine, and of a purer quality, its
action on that account may be more powerful. While one
portion of it decomposes the nitric acid of the nitre, with the
oxygen of which it forms carbonic acid; another portion is
thrown off in actual combustion, which puts on the appearance
we have mentioned. Lampblack, it is to be observed,
is a very impalpable powder, and takes fire with more facility
than pulverised charcoal.</p>

<p>The lampblack, therefore, is consumed both by the oxygen
of the nitre, and the oxygen gas furnished by the atmospheric
air. With respect to the sulphur, it facilitates the combustion,
as it is more readily inflamed, and it forms in the
process of combustion, sulphurous acid gas. Spur fire has been
improved by the addition of steel filings: They produce very
brilliant scintillations, in the combustion of which, oxide of
iron is formed.</p>

<p>With respect to the composition of rockets, the materials
of which are united in different proportions, we will
remark at this time, that as mealed powder, saltpetre, and
charcoal constitute their principal ingredients, the chemical
effect is similar to that we have stated. The combustion
of such mixtures is attributed to the same cause; for whether
we consider the composition of gunpowder, or the extra
addition of saltpetre and charcoal, or the substitution
of nitre for the gunpowder, the action must be the same,
and therefore the products of combustion, similar. The
action, however, as the effect evidently shows, is affected by
the proportion of the substances employed, and by other circumstances
which we shall notice hereafter. The different appearances,
therefore, are owing entirely to the composition,
as in <i>rocket stars</i>, <i>rains</i>, <i>gerbes</i>, <i>tourbillons</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>It may appear surprising, that the combustion of gunpowder
with other substances, previously well rammed in
cases, as in the rocket, will give to the case a <i>momentum</i> of
great velocity and force. This motion is regulated by the
<i>balance</i> of the rocket; and its <i>power</i> depends upon the size of
the case, and the compactness of the composition. There
is nothing new, however, in the fact; for it is perfectly famili<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>ar
with every one, if we consider the recoil of a gun when
fired, the powder having a resistance to overcome, as the
ball, that the explosive effect of gunpowder is equal, and
that the gases produced impel on all sides. Now the effect
of a ball is as the difference of its weight with the weight of
the gun; while the one being so much lighter is propelled
forward with great celerity, and with a corresponding projectile
force, the other suffers but little motion, which we
term the recoil. The combustion of the materials, of which
a rocket is composed, in a case, and in many fire-works
where the cases are arranged on wheels, &amp;c. which act on
the rocket-principle, produces in like manner a force proportionate
to the quantity of the material employed, and the
manner it is driven in the case. The force in such instances
is given to the rocket by the combustible substances; and
the rocket itself when free, will ascend, or move in the direction
required; or if small cases are fixed on wheels, which
move on an axis, they communicate motion, as in the single
vertical wheels, horizontal wheels, plural wheels, and the like,
and may then be considered a moving power. That rockets
are used as a missile weapon is well known. They were
employed by the native troops of India against the British
during the siege of Seringapatam in 1799. Mr. Congreve,
the inventor of the <i>war-rocket</i> which bears his name, may
have received his first idea of using rockets from this circumstance.
This rocket will be described hereafter. The
projectile force of the rocket is well calculated for the conveyance
of case shot to great distances; because, as it proceeds,
its velocity is accelerated instead of being retarded,
as happens with every other projectile, while the average
velocity of the shell is greater than that of the rocket only in
the ratio of 9 to 8. The basis of this increase of power in the
flight of rockets, induced Congreve to make a number of experiments,
which resulted in their improvement, so far as
they may be used of various calibres, either for explosion or
conflagration, and armed both with shells and case shot. It
may be sufficient to remark, that the 32 pr. rocket carcass,
which has been used in bombardment, will range 3000 yards
with the same quantity of combustible matter as that contained
in the ten inch spherical carcass.</p>

<p>M. de Buffon, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires de l'Académie</cite>, 1740,) wrote an
ingenious essay on sky rockets, in which he states the appendages
which may be put to them.</p>

<p>If we inquire into the cause of the ascension of rockets,
it will appear, that this apparently extraordinary effect, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
we have already remarked, is owing to the decomposition,
and the consequent production and disengagement of a large
quantity of gaseous fluid and caloric. The impelling power,
as in the large Congreve rocket, of which we had occasion
to speak, is regulated in proportion to its size, and the accuracy
with which the materials have been driven.</p>

<p>The manner in which the flame, and, consequently, the
gases are expelled from the orifice of a rocket, resembles the
operation of an æolipile, which throws out the vapour of
water, and sets in motion the air in its vicinity. As the
more flexible must yield to the more solid body, so, in this
respect, the gases produced are repelled by the air in contact
with the orifice of the rocket. Thus it follows, that the
rocket <i>displaces</i> a volume of air of a much greater weight
than itself. The rocket then has upon the air, reasoning <i>a
priori</i>, the same effect as the oars of a boat have upon water;
and hence, the greater the volume of fire from the rocket,
the greater is its velocity and ascent. The impelling force
also increases as it consumes, being a uniformly accelerated
motion.</p>

<p>It also appears, that a rocket sent in an horizontal direction
will not pass over so great a distance, as when its motion
is vertical; for, a rocket, directed in a line parallel to the
horizon, passes through a medium of equal density, but if
directed perpendicular to the horizon, from the moment
it leaves the ground till it arrives at its greatest height, it
penetrates and passes through an atmosphere whose density
is continually decreasing, and consequently its impelling
force meets with less resistance. But when we consider the
increase of the force of the rocket, there is no comparison
between that force, and the diminution of the density of the
air.</p>

<p>From these premises it follows, that the ascension of
rockets of all kinds is governed by one principle, namely,
the disengagement of gaseous fluids and caloric, which displacing
an equal volume of atmospheric air, operates by
mutual contact.</p>

<p>Since, however, the air is heavier than the gases produced
by the rocket, as the latter are greatly expanded, it is evident,
that the gases will ascend; their specific gravity at the time
of dilatation being less than that of the air.</p>

<p>The gases proceeding from the interior of the rocket, act
therefore upon the air in the immediate vicinity of the orifice,
and the rocket is consequently propelled, the stick guiding
it in the direction given to it. If it were not for the
rocket-stick or balance, its direction would be neither regu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>lar
nor certain. Considering then, that, by the rocket-stick,
the centre of gravity is changed from the rocket itself to the
stick, the motion is regulated in its perpendicular flight by
the stick. The rocket-stick must be always of a proportionate
length and weight to the rocket.</p>

<p>The motion given to rockets is always to be considered, for
this depends upon the direction at first imparted; but the
force of ascension is regulated by the size, and other circumstances
which we have mentioned.</p>

<p>Assuming the principle of constant force acting upon the
rocket, its velocity will increase with the time, and will be
as the squares of the time, according to the principles of uniform
accelerated motion; but if the force varies from uniformity,
then the velocity and spaces will proportionably vary.</p>

<p>As action and re-action must be equal, the repulsion produced
by the action of the gases upon the air is equal to the
force impelling the rocket. The constant action produces
equal acceleration of the motion.</p>

<p>On the subject of the condensation and dilatation of air,
and the different pressures at a mean temperature, which is
more or less connected with this inquiry, the reader may
consult with advantage, the work of Mr. Biot, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de
Physique</cite>, &amp;c. tome i, p. 110, and 141.) The conclusions of
Mr. Robins on the gaseous products of gunpowder, and
the elasticity of those products, may be seen by referring to
the article on <i>gunpowder</i>.</p>

<p>It must be confessed, that the theory of rockets differs in
many essential particulars from that of the usual projectiles;
for the motion of rockets is more complicated than that of
common projectiles, and is described to partake of all the
anomalies that attend the accelerated motion arising from the
rocket composition, and the uniform motion of the rocket-case,
after the composition is expended. It is a fact, which
appears to be established, that little or no advantage has yet
been gained from the experiments that have been made with
cannon, even where the angle of elevation, and the initial
velocity of the ball were both accurately known. It seems totally
useless to look for mathematical investigations, with
respect to determining the ranges, &amp;c. of military rockets;
because, if we could determine, with the greatest accuracy,
the point, position, and velocity of the rocket, at the moment
when the composition was expended, the remaining part of
its track would still be subject to all the inequalities attending
on common projectiles. During the burning of the rocket,
however, its motion might, by a series of experiments,
be reduced to precise rules. As the principles of gunnery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
or rather of projectiles, involve a number of collateral circumstances,
such as the exact momentum of any given ball when
projected with a given velocity, and from a given distance,
the subject is still not fully settled; but they are so far conclusive,
that the resistance of the air to the same ball is as some
function of the velocity. The remarks of Dr. Hutton on this
head would be too lengthy. A rocket, however, is very different.
The very medium, in this case, is the principal agent in
producing the motion; and being enabled to ascertain all the
successive energies of the propelling power, and the resisting
force, we may thus far determine correctly. It is suggested,
that a rocket fixed to the ballistic pendulum would determine
its whole energy; but, in order to make the experiment
more perfect, it is proposed to attach it to a wheel, or revolving
body, and then to measure its successive energies by the
motion of some weight attached to the revolving axis of the
machine. It is worthy of remark, that it is impossible to
accommodate or determine the motion of rockets by other
projectiles; and, therefore, to ascertain their momentum, such
a contrivance would be eminently useful.</p>

<p>Mr. Moore of the Royal Military Academy, Great Britain,
(<cite>Treatise on the motion and flight of rockets</cite>,) who seems
to have adopted the hypothesis of Dr. Desaguliers, respecting
the momentum of the ignited composition, has given a variety
of problems relative to the motion and flight of rockets
in non-resisting mediums, some of which we purpose to notice.</p>

<p>Mariotte and Desaguliers have given two distinct theories
of the motion of rockets. The latter ascribes their motion to
the momentum of combustion, and the former to the elastic
nature of the gaseous fluid, generated by the combustion,
and the resistance of air. The observations of Desaguliers
are the following: "Conceive the rocket to have no vent at
the choke, and to be set on fire, the consequence will be, either
that the rocket will burst in the weakest place, or if all
the parts be equally strong, and be able to sustain the impulse
of the flame, the rocket would burn out immoveable.
Now, as the force of the flame is equable, suppose its action
downwards, or that upwards, to lift 40 pounds; as these forces
are equal, but their directions contrary, they will destroy
each other's action. Imagine then the rocket opened at the
choke; by this means, the action of the flame downwards is
taken away, and there remains a force equal to forty pounds,
acting upwards, to carry up the rocket and stick." This theory,
however ingenious, is not altogether true; for it is asserted
on the contrary, that the action of the flame or gas
within the rocket, when closed, as supposed above, is con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>ceived
to arise wholly from the elastic nature of the gas, and
the reaction it experiences against the ends and sides of the
rocket-case; the whole of which ceases as soon as a free vent
is given to the flame; and, therefore, if a rocket could be
fixed in a vacuum, as the flame would, in that case, experience
no resistance, there would be no reaction, and consequently,
no motion would ensue. Some experiments, analogous
to this position, have been made. We may merely add,
with respect to Mariotte's theory, that he attributes the motion
of the rocket to the resistance and reaction of the air, in
consequence of which the propelling force will decrease as
the velocity increases, owing to the partial vacuum left behind
the rocket in its flight; so that the correct solution of
the problem necessarily involves the integration of partial
differences of the highest orders.</p>

<p>We may remark also, from the premises already established,
that the first motion of the rocket, like all other motions
not produced by a great momentary impulse, is slow; and
before the stick is clear of the flame, gravity has been acting
upon the rocket, and depressed it below its natural position,
while the stick is prevented from being equally depressed,
by the top of the frame; so that the angle of projection is
in fact considerably less than the angle of the frame, or
slope of the rocket's first position. In consequence of this,
the rocket has the appearance of falling the moment after
projection; and, for this reason also, the angle for producing
the greatest range of a rocket exceeds very considerably that
which gives the extreme range of a shell projected from a
mortar. There are various propositions given by Mr. Moore
respecting rockets, but to give the calculus, &amp;c. would take
up more room than we could appropriate to this abstract
question. The nature of these propositions, however, may be
given in a few words, <i>viz</i>: The strength or force of the gas
from the inflamed composition of a rocket being given, as also
the weight and quantity of the composition, the time of
its burning, and the weight and dimensions of the case and
stick, to find the height to which it will ascend, when projected
perpendicularly upwards. After making the necessary
calculation, he concludes by observing, that, having determined
the height of the rocket, and its velocity, when the composition
is just consumed, it follows that its whole height
may be determined in the usual manner by the known formula,
for the ascent and descent of heavy bodies. Another
proposition is that of determining the path of a rocket near
the earth's surface, neglecting the resistance of the air; and
among others, for finding the horizontal range of a rocket,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the angle of elevation, and the time the composition is on
fire, being given.</p>

<p>The observations of Mr. Peyre, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Mouvement Igné</cite>,) are
confined principally to the effects of gunpowder; and although
applied to the use of gunpowder, and the theory of its explosive
effects, yet there is nothing in immediate relation
with this subject. The generation of gaseous fluid, and its
impelling power, and the consequent recoil of pieces, predicated
in fact on the ingenious experiments and conclusions of
Mr. Robins, may furnish some data on this head. But the
principles of accelerated motion, on which the effective power
of war-rockets depends, this accelerated motion being
no other than the acquired velocity of their recoil, necessarily
involves a question of a different kind from that of common
projectiles.</p>

<p>The <i>caduceus</i> rocket has not much more than half the
power of ascension as the single rockets; because, being
composed of two rockets placed at an angle of 90 degrees,
with the usual counterpoise, (the stick), it forms in its flight
a serpentine motion resembling two spiral lines, or double
worm; and although by reason of the stick it ascends
vertically, yet the great resistance it meets with from the
air, in consequence of this motion, causes its flight to be
considerably retarded.</p>

<p>On the contrary, when rockets are fixed one on the top of
another, called <i>towering rockets</i>, their effect is not at all diminished;
for they experience no additional resistance, as the
small rocket is placed in the head of the large one; and when
the latter arrives at the maximum of elevation, it communicates
fire to the former, which then rises as far beyond the
first, if not higher, in consequence of the pressure of the atmosphere
being less, as it would, if discharged by itself on
the ground. Sky rockets, however, which are merely placed
on one stick, do not, unless so required, act in this manner.
Although two, three, or more, may be so arranged, yet the intention
is nothing more than to combine their effect, so that
their tails may appear as one stream of fire. Nevertheless,
they may be so arranged, as that when one is consumed,
another may take its place, and produce a new volume of
fire, and, in this case, they would mount to a great height.</p>

<p><i>Tourbillons</i>, usually called the common or table <i>tourbillons</i>,
which receive their name from the whirling motion they take
in their flight, produce also, by the arrangement of their cases,
and the cross stick which serves as a balance, a horizontal
and rotary motion; and while one part of the fire serves to
elevate them, another part, issuing in a horizontal direction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
but at opposite sides and extremities, gives to the tourbillon
a wheeling motion. The mosaic tourbillons are of a different
kind, and intended for another effect. Tourbillons of this kind
preserve a regular and constant motion.</p>

<p>The <i>mosaic candle</i> owes its effect, in a great measure, to
the rocket composition. Using alternately, composition, meal-powder,
and a star, ramming the composition sufficiently, but
not so as to break the stars, a case is formed, the effect of
which is brilliant and striking. Besides the rapid combustion
of the composition, the stars, when the fire comes to the
meal-powder, are thrown out by it in succession, and to the
height of one hundred and more feet. We have also, in this
instance, the effect of the rocket composition, and that of
gunpowder; the last of which, acting in the case in the same
manner as powder in a musket on a ball, throws the stars to
a great height. Hence the <i>effect</i> is varied according to the
manner of loading the case; and by employing alternately the
substances we have mentioned, the effects follow in regular
succession. The use of gunpowder in this manner, is strikingly
shown in many other fire-works. When, for instance,
stars, serpents, &amp;c. forming the furniture of a rocket, are to
be dispersed, gunpowder is put in the head or conical cap of
the rocket, and fire is communicated to it at the moment the
rocket has arrived at its extreme elevation. In the bursting
of paper shells, the same effect ensues, and the different substances
contained in the shell are dispersed in every direction.</p>

<p>Balloons are nothing more than shells made either of paper,
or wood turned hollow. These balloons are discharged
from mortars, or fire-pots, sometimes called pots of ordnance.
They are merely cylinders of various diameters, made of paper
and very thick, or of metal, and are furnished at their
bottom with a conical cavity lined with copper, designed to
hold the charge of powder. When the balloon is filled, (see
<a href="#BALx"><i>Balloons</i></a>), it is introduced into the mortar over the charge,
and being furnished with a fuse as in other shells, takes fire
the moment the powder is inflamed. According to the quantity
of powder made use of, so will be the height of ascension.
By determining the ascension, and the time required for the
fuse to burn, and communicate fire to the shell, we may fix
the precise moment for its explosion. The powder contained
in the shell is sufficient only to burst it, and disperse its contents.
(See <a href="#MORx"><i>Mortars</i></a>, <a href="#FIRx"><i>Fire-pots</i></a>, and <a href="#POTx"><i>pots of Aigrette</i></a>.)</p>

<p>A balloon will contain more stars, serpents, &amp;c. than the
head of an ordinary rocket, and the effect which they pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>duce,
must of course be more striking. The Congreve rocket,
calculated as it is to convey carcass composition, balls, grenades,
&amp;c. if furnished with stars, crackers, &amp;c. would produce
an effect equal, if not superior to the balloon.</p>

<p>We remarked, that, in common sky rockets, the charges
consist of a mixture of gunpowder, saltpetre, and charcoal,
with occasionally other additions, as steel-filings. <i>Rocket-stars</i>,
on the contrary, are usually formed of mealed powder,
saltpetre, sulphur, and sometimes other substances according
to the colour of the flame required. Thus, for the
<i>white star</i>, composition oil of spike, (a preparation of Barbadoes
tar, and spirit of turpentine), and camphor are employed;
the camphor giving to the flame a white appearance.
The <i>blue stars</i> owe their colour to sulphur, which is in the
proportion of one to four of the meal-powder; the <i>variegated
stars</i> have the same materials, with sulphur vivum, and
camphor; and the <i>brilliant stars</i>, <i>common stars</i>, and a variety
of others, we shall mention in their proper places, are all
formed by the addition of sundry substances.</p>

<p>The variety of <i>rains</i>, as <i>gold rain</i>, <i>silver rain</i>, &amp;c. are differently
prepared. Besides saltpetre, meal-powder, and
sulphur, gold rain contains in its composition the filings of
brass, saw-dust, and pulverized glass. In this instance, the
saw-dust communicates colour, while the brass and the
glass are thrown out, the former partly consumed, and the
latter partially fused by the intense heat. The same effect
may be produced by meal-powder, saltpetre, and charcoal,
or saltpetre, sulphur, antimony, brass filings, saw-dust,
and pulverized glass. Here the antimony, as well as the brass,
communicates the golden colour. (<i>See <a href="#ANTx">antimony.</a></i>) Silver rain
is generally formed of saltpetre, sulphur, meal-powder, antimony,
and sal prunelle, but without saw-dust; the antimony
communicating silver brilliancy to the flame. It may also be
formed, by employing, in given proportions, saltpetre, sulphur,
and charcoal, the particular effect depending upon
the proportions; or by using antimony in lieu of the charcoal,
or in the place of the antimony, steel-filings. Whether
antimony or steel-filings are used, the effect of their combustion
is the same, forming in the one instance, an oxide of
antimony, and in the other, an oxide of iron. Both gold and
silver rain is employed chiefly for sky-rockets. As to the
colours required, they may be formed of other substances.</p>

<p>The charges for <i>water-rockets</i> are also various. In some of
which, besides the usual ingredients, (meal-powder, salt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>petre,
and sulphur,) sea-coal, steel-filings, saw-dust, &amp;c. enter
into their composition.</p>

<p>As to the different compositions, it will be sufficient
to remark, that for <i>wheels</i>, <i>fixed cases</i>, <i>sun cases</i>, <i>gerbes</i>,
<i>Chinese fire</i>, <i>tourbillons</i>, <i>water balloons</i>, <i>water squibs</i>, <i>serpents</i>,
<i>port-fires</i>, <i>cones</i>, <i>globes</i>, <i>air-balloon fuses</i>, <i>fire-pumps</i>,
and many others to be noticed hereafter, the basis of them
is either gunpowder or saltpetre, and sulphur and charcoal,
with or without additions. With respect to the composition
of the stars of different colours, it is to be observed, that
the particular colour is given by <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'pluverized'">pulverized</ins> cast-iron, steel-filings,
camphor, amber, antimony, perchloride of mercury,
(corrosive sublimate), ivory-dust, copper, frankincense, &amp;c.
To produce <i>tails of sparks</i>, pitch or rosin is added. Stars
which produce <i>some</i> sparks are usually made by using gum
water in mixing the composition. The gum appears to produce
a separation of the inflammable substances, and, as it
is not combustible, to check, as it were, the rapidity of the
combustion. In some preparations, also, isinglass or fish-glue
is used in solution. This, no doubt, acts in the same manner,
as well as to give firmness to the composition; but its solution
is also used as a vehicle. On the same principle also, we
learn the use of caustic ley, quicklime, &amp;c. in preparing match-rope.
After soaking the cord in a solution of nitre, it is afterwards
dipped into ley, which is nothing more than a solution
of potash rendered caustic by means of quicklime.
The potash evidently checks the combustion. The formulæ
for slow match, are, however, various. In the match-wood,
also, prepared from the wood or bark of the linden, the wood
is usually first soaked in a solution of saltpetre, and afterwards
in a solution of acetate or sugar of lead, &amp;c. For the
same purpose, nitrate of copper is recommended. For stars
of a yellow colour, besides gum arabic, or gum tragacanth,
saltpetre, and sulphur, the addition of powdered glass, orpiment,
(sulphuret of arsenic), and white amber, are occasionally
made. The colour is owing to the amber and the orpiment,
which have the property of communicating it to
flame. We may observe, generally, that the colours produced
by different compositions, is a subject of importance to the
pyrotechnist. He should know the properties of each substance,
and the effect of each ingredient; and, with respect to
their action, be able to <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'foretel'">foretell</ins> the appearance of the flame,
and other circumstances connected with the art. As a general
example, we may state, that sulphur gives a blue;
camphor, a white, or pale colour; saltpetre, a clear white
yellow; amber, a colour inclining to yellow; muriate of am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>monia,
(sal ammoniac), a green; antimony, a reddish; rosin,
a copper colour, and Greek pitch, a bronze, or a colour
between red and yellow. In using these substances, the following
remarks may be useful;&mdash;that for producing a white
flame, the saltpetre should be the chief part; for blue, the
sulphur; for flame inclining to red, the saltpetre should be the
principal ingredient, using at the same time, antimony and
pitch. (See <a href="#MATx"><i>matches of different colours</i></a>, in Part ii.)</p>

<p>Coloured flame may be produced by various other substances,
many of which are expensive, and therefore could
not be employed economically. Thus, in fire-works made
with hydrogen gas, or inflammable air, which have a pleasing
effect, by forcing the gas, either from a bladder, oiled-silk
bag, or gas-holder, through a variety of revolving jets, which
are so arranged as to exhibit stars, or through pipes furnished
with small apertures, &amp;c. to resemble different standing
figures,&mdash;the effect may be varied by previously mixing
the gas with the vapour of ether, and other substances, which
communicate to the flame, particular colours, which, in
a darkened room, are extremely brilliant. Cartwright's fire-works
are formed in this manner. (See <a href="#FIRy"><i>fire-works with inflammable
air</i></a>.)</p>

<p>Muriate of strontian, mixed with alcohol, or spirit of wine,
will give a carmine-red flame. For this experiment, one part
of the muriate is added to three or four parts of alcohol. Muriate
of lime produces, with alcohol, an orange-coloured
flame. Nitrate of copper produces an emerald-green flame.
Common salt and nitre, with alcohol, give a yellow flame.
(See <a href="#ILLx"><i>Illuminations and Transparencies</i></a>.)</p>

<p>In addition to the facts already stated, it may be proper to
observe, that the ingredients employed to <i>show in sparks</i>,
which are rammed in <i>choaked cases</i>, are various, according
to the colours required; as black, white, gray, and red. The
black charges are composed of meal-powder and charcoal;
the white, of saltpetre, sulphur, and charcoal; the gray, of
meal powder, saltpetre, sulphur, and charcoal; and the red,
of meal-powder, charcoal, and saw-dust. These are considered
regular or set charges, to which we may add two others,
called compound and brilliant charges. The compound charges
contain a variety of substances which afford sparks; and
hence, besides the usual inflammable bodies, saw-dust, antimony,
steel and brass-filings, are used. The brilliant fires
owe their particular effect to the presence of steel-filings, or
pulverized cast-iron. Iron, in any of its states, when minutely
divided, has the same effect.</p>

<p>Quick match is usually formed of cotton, by soaking it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
a solution of nitre, and adding meal-powder. A solution of
isinglass is sometimes used. The etoupille of the French is
of the same nature. The manner, quick and slow match, &amp;c.
are prepared, with the various formulæ, will be considered
under their respective heads. Touch paper, for capping serpents,
crackers, &amp;c. will also be noticed. The pyrotechnical
spunge owes its inflammability to nitre.</p>

<p>In the various composition of aquatic fire-works, although
more care and attention are required, it is to be observed,
that, in forming water-rockets, horizontal wheels, water-mines,
fire-globes, water-balloons, water-squibs, water-fire-fountains,
and the like, substances are generally used along
with the usual ingredients, which, under particular circumstances,
may be said to <i>repel</i>, as well as resist the action of
the water; and in this particular they resemble the celebrated
Greek fire, of which we shall speak hereafter. This
remark, however, applies only to certain works. After the
rockets have been filled, their ends are dipped in melted rosin
or sealing-wax, or secured with grease.</p>

<p>Fire-works, usually exhibited in rooms, are made with
odoriferous gums and perfumes, and hence are called odoriferous
fire-works. We may remark, that the odour or perfume
is given by a variety of substances; for these, at a high
temperature, are partly consumed, and partly evaporated.
Thus camphor, yellow amber, flowers of benzoin, myrrh,
frankincense, cedar-raspings, and the essential oils, particularly
of bergamot, are employed for this purpose. Scented fire-works
are of the same character. The Italians and the French,
who have made more experiments in Pyrotechny, than other
nations, have improved odoriferous fire-works. In these
compositions, they also employ storax, calamite, gum benzoin,
and other substances. <i>Scented fire</i> was greatly in use in
Egypt, Rome, and Athens, at their fetes and public ceremonies.
The unpleasant smell which gunpowder, sulphur, &amp;c.
occasion in a confined apartment, has induced the modern artificers
to add sundry odoriferous substances to their pyro-mixtures.
On this subject, it will be sufficient to observe,
that the <i>scented vase</i>, which was in use at Athens, contained
the following substances: storax, benzoin, frankincense, camphor,
gum juniper in grains, and charcoal of the willow. It
does not appear that nitre was employed. The custom of burning
frankincense before the altar, is indeed very ancient; for, in
the primitive temple at Jerusalem, the custom was adopted
by the priests in the Sanctum Sanctorum, and is continued by
the Greeks and Armenians, the Jews, the Turks, the Per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>sians,
(especially the followers of Zoroaster), preserve this
custom. The <i>Holy Fire</i> of the latter is nothing more than
the inflamed carburetted hydrogen gas, which comes from the
naphtha ground at Baku.</p>

<p>Besides the use of nitre in pyrotechnical compositions, as
it forms an essential part in all of them, there is another salt
we had occasion to notice, of which an account will be given
hereafter, that affords a variety of amusing experiments. This
salt is the hyperoxymuriate or chlorate of potassa. Although
it has neither been used for fire-works on an extensive scale,
nor does it enter into any of the compositions usually made
for exhibition, yet its effect is not the less amusing. Some
general idea may be had of its effect, by stating a few experiments.
If a mixture of this salt and white sugar be made
in a mortar, and the mixture laid on a slab or tile, and a string
wetted with sulphuric acid, (oil of vitriol), be brought in contact
with it, or a drop or two of the acid be let fall upon it,
a vivid combustion will take place. In this experiment, the
acid decomposes the salt, and the oxygen unites with the carbon
and hydrogen of the sugar, and forms carbonic acid and
water. The same salt, rubbed in a mortar with sulphur, will
produce a crackling noise resembling that of a whip; and if
a mixture of the two be struck with a hammer, the percussion
will cause a loud detonation. The same thing happens
when phosphorus is used, but the detonation is more violent.
Various other experiments may be made with it. It
forms the principal part of the match, called the <i>pocket lights</i>.
These are made, in the first place, by dipping the wood previously
cut in splints in melted sulphur, and afterwards in a
mixture of this salt with sugar, which is moistened with water.
The match is then dried. When used, it is dipped in
sulphuric acid. The red colour, usually given to the match,
is formed by mixing with the composition some vermillion.
Another application of the same principle, is the firing of
cannon. For this purpose, after the tube is filled with powder,
a covering of the same mixture is applied when mixed
with water. It is then dried. When the tube is put in the vent,
a drop of sulphuric acid will inflame it, and consequently discharge
the gun. This salt also, when mixed with sulphur,
may be used to fire fowling pieces, provided the lock be so
constructed, as in a late invention, that it acts by percussion.
(See <a href="#THEx">Thenard's Priming powder.</a>)</p>

<p>The Rev. Alexander Forsyth of Alexander Forsyth of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Belhelaive'">Belhelvie</ins>, in Aberdeenshire,
Scotland, took out a patent for a new kind of gun-lock,
to be used without a flint, and has contrived to inflame pow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>der
merely by percussion. The powder employed for priming,
consists of chlorate of potassa and sulphur. The gun-lock
is calculated for firing cannon as well as musquetry; it
is contrived to hold forty primings of such powder; and the
act of raising the cock primes the piece. Each charge of priming
is supposed to contain one-eighth of a grain of the salt.
There are other substances which also produce fire by percussion.
The fulminating silver, mixed with any substance,
or used by itself, will detonate by percussion. It should be used
with great caution. A grain or two will explode with great
violence. (See <a href="#DETx"><i>Detonating Works</i></a>, <a href="#WATx"><i>Waterloo crackers</i></a>, <i>&amp;c.</i>)</p>

<p>There are several other metallic preparations which detonate
violently, such as the fulminating gold, fulminating mercury,
&amp;c. all of which must be used with extreme caution. (See
<a href="#FULx">the respective articles.</a>)</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. IV. Of Illuminations.</i></p>

<p>Although nothing of much importance can be said on the
subject of illumination, yet at the same time, as it is connected
with some remarks we will hereafter offer, it may be proper
to observe, that the practice of illuminating, as well as
the exhibition of fire-works in public rejoicings, has been in
use for many years. The former indeed has been customary
for many centuries. We have, however, appropriated an article
to the manner of forming illuminations and transparencies,
and also on imitative fire-works.</p>

<p>Illuminations, whether with lamps, candles, flambeaux, &amp;c.
may be rendered more impressive from the manner of their
arrangement. In some instances different coloured flames
have been used; and the effect in this case is more grand
and beautiful.</p>

<p>The public lighting of cities on festivals, and particularly
on joyful occasions, called illuminations, is of great antiquity.
Indeed, illuminations are a general expression of the
public feeling, and should, on important occasions, be encouraged.
Victories gained over an enemy by the army or navy
are subjects of rejoicing. While, in such cases, illuminations
may be viewed as an <i>expression</i> of the feelings of the people,
they serve moreover to stimulate, in the spirit of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amor
patriæ</i>, the future actions of the patriot and the soldier;
and while such rejoicings are demonstrative of victory, they
are equally expressive of that virtuous feeling, of which every
one must partake, on the return of an honourable peace.</p>

<p>What could have been more impressive than the brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
spectacle exhibited in Paris in 1739, on the return of peace?
Besides illuminations, the fire-works on that occasion were
truly magnificent. The same may be said of those at Pont
Neuf, and those at Versailles in the same year. We shall
have occasion to speak of them, when we come to the arrangement
or the order of fire-works for exhibition.</p>

<p>The Egyptians at an early period, made use of illuminations,
and particularly at a festival, which is mentioned by
the Greek authors. During the festival, as <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Heroditus'">Herodotus</ins> says,
lamps were placed before all the houses throughout the country,
and kept burning the whole night.</p>

<p>During the festival of the Jews, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">festum encæniorum</i>,
the feast of the Dedication of the Temple, the lamps were
lighted before each of the houses, and the festival continued
eight days. Illuminations were also used in Greece, according
to a passage in Æschylus. When games were exhibited
in the night-time at Rome, the forum was lighted. Caligula,
on a similar occasion, caused the city to be illuminated. In
honour of the great orator Cicero, as he was returning home
at night, after the defeat of Cataline's conspiracy, lamps and
torches were lighted in all the streets. Byzantium, afterwards
Constantinople, was ordered to be illuminated with lamps and
wax candles on an Easter eve, in the time of Constantine.</p>

<p>That this custom was prevalent among the christians in
the first century, is evident from many authors. Professor
Beckman, in his <cite>History of Inventions</cite>, vol. iii, p. 383, says,
that "the fathers of the first century frequently inveigh
against the christians, because, to please the heathens, they
often illuminated their houses, on idolatrous festivals, in a
more elegant manner than they. This they considered as a
species of idolatry. That the houses of the ancients were illuminated
on birth-days, by suspending lamps from chains,
is too well known to require any proof."</p>

<p>At Damascus, the Turks always keep a lamp burning over
the tomb, as it is called, of Ananias, which they much reverenced.
It is said to be in the same house in which St. Paul
lodged with Judas. (See <cite>Maundrel's Travels from Aleppo to
Jerusalem</cite>.)</p>

<p>Lamps, according to Dr. Pococke, are kept continually
burning in the Jewish synagogue at Old Cairo, said to have
been built about sixteen hundred years ago. (See <cite>Pococke's
Travels through Egypt</cite>.)</p>

<p>In Persia, lamps are kept burning in consequence of some
religious notion, and particularly at the sepulchre of Seid Ibraham.
(See <cite>Travels through Muscovy into Persia</cite>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>A lighted lamp is frequently put up in Persia as a mark to
shoot at. To be a good shot, the marksman must extinguish
it. At the celebration of the feast called Ashur or Ten, from
its lasting ten days, which is kept in memory of Hossein, the
youngest son of Hali, the Persians make use of rags dipped
in suet and naphtha, and burn them in lamps; and their courts
are lighted up with thousands of lamps, the light from which
is increased by as many more lanterns made of paper, that are
fastened to cords drawn across the court.</p>

<p>The Chinese, in celebrating their solemn feasts, especially
on the 15th day of the first month, called the Feast of the
lanterns, from the multitude and grandeur of the lamps
they exhibit in the evening, are remarkable for the splendour
of their exhibitions. We are informed, (<cite>A Description
of China, &amp;c.</cite>), that many of the grandees, retrenching
every year something from their tables, apparel, and equipage,
to show the greater magnificence in the lanterns, used
on this occasion, expend the sum of 2000 crowns. The largest
are about twenty feet in diameter, and are lighted by an immense
number of wax candles and lamps; but those that are
most common, are of a middling size. These are generally
composed of six faces, or panes, each of which has a frame
of varnished wood, adorned with gildings four feet high, a
foot and a half broad, covered on the inside with fine transparent
silk, on which are painted flowers, trees, rocks, and
sometimes human figures. The painting is very curious, the
colours lively, and the wax candles give the painting a beautiful
splendour. These six pannels joined together, compose
a hexagon, surmounted at the extremities by six carved figures,
that form its crown. Around it are hung broad strings
of satin, of all colours, with other silken ornaments, that fall
upon the angles without hiding the light of the pictures. The
feast of the lanterns is also celebrated by bonfires and fire-works.</p>

<p>Candles are also used for the same purpose. Chandeliers,
differently made, and holding a greater or smaller number
of candles, add greatly to the effect.</p>

<p>The candles used by the natives of Otaheite are curiously
made. According to Cooke, (<cite>First Voyage, &amp;c.</cite>), they have
candles made of a kind of oily nut, which they stick one over
another upon a skewer thrust through the middle of them.
The upper one being lighted, burns down to the second, at the
same time consuming that part of the skewer which goes
through it; the second, taking fire, burns in the same manner
down to the third, and so of the rest. These candles give a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
tolerable light, and some of them will burn a considerable
time.</p>

<p>The lighting of streets, Beckman considers in some respects
to be a modern invention, and after quoting various
authorities concludes, that, of modern cities, Paris was the
first that followed the example of the ancients by lighting its
streets. It appears, therefore, that the practice of illuminating
was reserved by the ancients for some great occasion,
that lighting of the streets was more or less partial, and confined
to particular places, and that it was not general without
some particular occasion called for it. (See <a href="#ILLx"><i>Illuminations</i>.</a>)</p>

<p>Kircher, the German philosopher, had a wick made of amianthus,
which burnt for two years without injury, and was at
last destroyed by accident.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The Greenland stone flax,
which is the same as amianthus, the Rev. Mr. Edge says is
used in Greenland for lamp wicks, and burn without being
in the least wasted, whilst supplied with oil or fat. Ellis
(<cite>Voyage for the Discovery of a North-West Passage</cite>),
found the mountain flax, (asbestus), among other minerals,
on the Resolution Islands, inhabited by the Esquimaux,
which is used for similar purposes. We may remark here,
that the Esquimaux use stone for lamps, which they hollow
out, and, according to circumstances, use also dried <i>goose
dung</i> for wick.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. V. Of some of the Feats or Performances by Fire.</i></p>

<p>We introduce this subject to show, that certain kinds of
fire-works have been employed for the purpose of deceiving
the ignorant, and amusing the better informed part of mankind.
Many of the tricks of jugglers and slight-of-hand men,
and the performances of certain rites, particularly by the
ancient magi, and pagan priests, come under this head. Sundry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
substances, in connection with artificial fire, have been
employed by persons of this description. It is true, our account
of them is rather imperfect. Had the works of Celsius,
which he wrote against the ancient magi, been preserved,
we would, no doubt, have been better acquainted
with the art of the ancient conjurors and jugglers.</p>

<p>Professor Beckman has endeavoured to trace the origin of
the necromantic art; but although of opinion that it is very
ancient, and founded in superstition and unnatural causes, he
is of opinion, that the works of Celsius, which are lost,
were full on the subject, and for that reason our account
must be imperfect.</p>

<p>Plain common sense, but with enlightened reason, has
alone convinced mankind of the follies of older generations,
and of relying on superstitious ceremonies, or believing in
miracles, exorcism, conjuration, necromancy, sorcery, or
witchcraft.</p>

<p>The torch of reason, and experimental philosophy have
dispelled the clouds of ignorance and superstition; and men,
becoming more enlightened as they progress in the investigation
of truth, are no longer under the influence of false
doctrines, or led away by a bigoted priesthood. Philosophical
experiments, the various optical illusions, the
effects of electricity, magnetism, &amp;c. are founded on immutable
truths, which become the more familiar as we progress
in science.</p>

<p>Truth, however, although elicited by the genius of great
men, who have lived in every age, was suffered to be
brought to the rack; because it either militated against the
views of the priesthood, and enlightened the people, or curtailed
the ecclesiastical power and authority of the church.</p>

<p>Because Anaxagoras taught that the sun and stars were
not deities, but masses of corruptible matter, he was tried
and condemned in Greece. Accusations of a similar nature
contributed to the death of Socrates. Copernicus, in consequence
of the threats of bigots and the fear of persecution, was
prevented from publishing, during his life time, his discovery
of the true system of the world; and it is well known,
that the great Galileo was imprisoned a year, and then
obliged to renounce the motion of the earth, because he
asserted it. In 1742, a commentary on Newton's <cite>Principia</cite>,
one of the first productions of human genius, was not allowed
to be printed at Rome, in consequence of its promulgation
of this doctrine; and, in the true spirit of <i>priest-craft</i>,
the commentators were obliged to prefix to their work a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
declaration, <i>that on this point, they submitted to the decisions
of the supreme pontiffs</i>! Such are the results of bigotry, ignorance,
superstition, and especially of civil and ecclesiastical
governments, that consider learning a curse, and ignorance
a blessing! Happily for the people of the United States,
their co-equal rights and enlightened reason, will ever guarantee
them against tyranny on the one hand, and fanaticism
on the other. Superstition has always been an engine of
oppression, and wherever it prevails, the powerful are sure
to make use of it to oppress and destroy the weak.</p>

<p>Another instance of the assumed prerogative of the holy
fathers may be found in their conduct towards the house of
Medici; for the pontiffs, it is known, induced the house of
Medici, by granting it the cardinalship, to suppress the academy
del Cimento. The reason of this step is obvious to
all; for they were sensible, that, if the people became once
enlightened, they would lose their weight, their influence,
and authority. But as jugglers are conscious of their gross
deceptions, working on the imagination and credulity of the
multitude, they in this respect appear at least to know themselves.
Like the juggler mentioned in Xenophon, who requested
the gods to allow him to remain in places, where
there was much money and abundance of simpletons, they
acted as the prototype. We might enumerate, if it were
not irrelevant to our subject, a number of facts concerning
these impostors.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>The miracles wrought by Moses, as recorded in the books
of Exodus, were, we have reason to believe, by the immediate
command of a supreme power. When Moses had commissioned
Aaron (<cite>Exodus</cite>, chap. vii, verse 9, 10, &amp;c.) to be
a prophet, Aaron took a rod and cast it before Pharaoh and
his servants, and it became a serpent; but it seems, however,
that Pharaoh called the wise men and the sorcerers, called the
magicians of Egypt, who performed the same thing with
their enchantments; "for they cast down every man his
rod, and they became serpents: <i>but Aaron's rod swallowed
up their rods</i>." It appears that on another occasion, the
waters were turned into blood by smiting them with
the rod; "and the magicians of Egypt did so with their
enchantments." When Aaron was commanded to stretch
forth his hand with his rod over the streams, &amp;c. frogs appeared
upon the land, and the magicians did so likewise;
but when vermin were brought forth, by smiting the land,
the magicians were unsuccessful, and said unto Pharaoh,
"<i>This is the finger of God</i>." In the continuation of the plague,
Moses and Aaron were commanded to take the ashes of the
furnace, before Pharaoh, and sprinkle them up towards Heaven;
and it became a hail on man and beast, but the magicians
were affected, and could not stand before Moses. When
Moses stretched forth his rod towards heaven "hail, and
fire mingled with hail," came down; and on another occasion,
they brought forth locusts. When this plague ceased, Moses
caused darkness to prevail.</p>

<p>We will merely observe, that, with regard to the magi of
Egypt, who it is known possessed all the learning of the day,
and were celebrated in after ages for superior wisdom, so
much so that many of the Grecians resorted there to be
initiated into their mysteries,&mdash;they were of a different description
from those who really worked miracles, according
to divine inspiration. Hence we find, that, although distinct
in their character, the magicians of Egypt pretended to perform
certain rites, and to work upon the feelings of the people.
Their initiary process, which the Pythagoreans in many respects
pursued, and traces of which are extant in the order of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
free-masonry, was merely intended to preserve their knowledge
within the pale of, and veiled in, hieroglyphic mystery,
which none but the initiated could understand. Priestley,
in his <cite>Institutes of Moses</cite>, points out the difference between
the magi, so called, and the rites and ceremonies of the
ancient Hebrews. But the imposition practised on mankind,
even in modern times, aided by engines of the most abominable
kind, as instruments of torture, in the inquisitorial
tribunals of Portugal and Spain, are sufficient of themselves
to call down the vengeance of impartial justice.</p>

<p>That the magicians were conscious of their inability to
work miracles, is evident from their own declaration; for,
after vermin had been brought forth by Moses and Aaron,
they endeavoured to do the same, and being unsuccessful
declared, that <i>this was the finger of God</i>; and many other
instances are recorded of their attempts being altogether
abortive. It appears also, that at first they believed they
were able to perform all that Moses had done; and Pharaoh
himself, by calling them together for that purpose, seemed
to be of the same opinion, until he and his servants were
finally convinced that Moses and Aaron wrought such miracles
by inspiration. There can be no relation whatever between
Moses and the magicians; for although he was, if we
may judge from biblical history, acquainted with all the
knowledge of the magicians, his mission was altogether of a
different character. Many of the modern Greek and Armenian
priests, in their celebration of the holy fire, palm
upon their credulous followers, a belief, that they possess
the power of working miracles, as will appear from the account
we shall give of them. We will not enlarge on this
subject at present, but pass on to consider the more common
performances, which have excited the wonder and admiration
of mankind.</p>

<p>The deception of breathing out flames, which excites the
astonishment of the ignorant, is very ancient. When the
slaves of Sicily, about two centuries ago, made a formidable
insurrection, and avenged themselves in a cruel manner for
the severities which they had suffered, there was among
them a Syrian named Eunus, a man of great craft and
courage, who, having passed through many scenes of life,
had become acquainted with a variety of arts. He pretended
to have immediate communication with the gods; was
the oracle and leader of his fellow slaves; and, as is usual
on such occasions, confirmed his divine mission by miracles.
When, heated by enthusiasm, he was desirous of inspi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>ring
his followers with courage, he breathed flames or sparks
among them from his mouth while he was addressing them.
We are told by historians, that, for this purpose, he pierced
a nut shell at both ends, and, having filled it with some burning
substance, put it into his mouth and breathed through
it. Some affirm, that he used tow previously soaked in a
solution of saltpetre. The deception at present is much better
performed. The juggler rolls together some flax or
hemp; sets it on fire; and suffers it to burn till it is nearly
consumed; he then rolls round it, while burning, some more
flax, and by these means the fire may be retained in it a long
time. When he wishes to exhibit, he slips the ball into his
mouth and breathes through it; which again revives the fire,
so that a number of weak sparks proceed from it; and the
performer sustains no hurt, provided he inspire the air not
through the mouth but the nostrils.</p>

<p>By this art, the rabbi Bar-Cacheba, in the reign of the emperor
Hadrian, made the credulous Jews believe, that he was
the hoped for Messias, and two centuries after, the emperor
Constantius was thrown into great terror, when Valentian
informed him, that he had seen one of the body guards breathing
out fire and flames in the evening.</p>

<p>It appears evident from the writings of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Heroditus'">Herodotus</ins>, that the
ancients possessed a knowledge of attracting lightning, or
the electric fluids with pointed instruments made of iron.
He informs us, that the Thracians disarmed heaven of its
thunder-bolts, by discharging arrows into the air; and the
Hyperboreans by darting into the clouds, pikes headed with
pieces of sharp pointed iron.</p>

<p>Pliny speaks of a process, by which Porsena caused fire
from the heavens to fall upon a monster which ravaged his
country. He mentions also, that Numa Pompilius, and
Tullius Hostilius practised certain mysterious rites to call
down the fire from heaven. What these mysterious rites
were is of no moment; the fact is sufficient. Tullius, because
he omitted some prescribed ceremony, is said to have been
killed by the fire. A similar accident happened in France
with the electrical kite.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>For deceptions with fire, the ancients employed a number
of inflammable substances, which they dexterously used;
among them, naphtha, a fine bituminous oil, which readily
inflames, was principally used. (For the effect of <i>naphtha</i>, <i>see</i>
<i>Greek fire</i>.) Galen informs us, that a person excited great
surprise by extinguishing a candle, and again lighting it
without any other process than holding it against a wall or a
stone. This, Galen observes, (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Temperamentis</cite>, iii. 2, p.
44.) was effected in consequence of the wall or stone being
previously rubbed with sulphur, which, however, must have
been something more. He also speaks of a mixture of sulphur
and naphtha. If it had been phosphorus, or some of its
preparations, it would appear more probable.</p>

<p>Plutarch relates the secret effects of naphtha, and observes,
that Alexander was astonished and delighted, when
it was exhibited to him in Ecbatana. Medea destroyed
Creusa, the daughter of Creon, with this oil. This fact is
stated by Plutarch, Pliny, Galen, and others, and believed
by Beckman. She sent, it appears, to the unfortunate princess,
a dress covered with it, which burst into flames as soon
as she approached the fire of the altar. The dress of Hercules,
which also took fire, was dipped in naphtha, though
said to be in the blood of Nessus. On the subject of naphtha,
Beckman remarks, "that this oil must have been employed
when offerings caught fire in an imperceptible manner. <i>In
all periods of the world, priests have acted as jugglers to simple
and ignorant people.</i>"</p>

<p>The most ludicrous account of the necromantic art, by
which similar tricks were performed, is that given by Celini,
(<cite>Life of Benvenuto Celini</cite>, a Florentine Artist, by T. Nugent,
LL. D. &amp;c.) of a Sicilian priest, who drew circles on
the floor with various ceremonies, using fire and different
perfumes. Having made an opening to the circle, and thrown
perfumes into the fire at a proper time, he observes, that
in the space of an hour and half, "there appeared several
legions of devils, insomuch that the amphitheatre was quite
filled with them." Benvenuto, it seems, at the instance of
the priest, asked some favours of them, which, however, he
never realized. At a second exhibition he held a <i>pentagorun</i>,
while the priests questioned the leaders of the demons
"by the virtue and power of the eternal uncreated God,"
using the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin languages. The Demons
appeared more numerous than at first, and more formidable.
He states that "quivering like an aspen leaf, he
took good care of the <i>perfumes</i>," and was directed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
priest "to burn proper perfumes." This ceremony was continued
until the "bell rang for morning prayers," and the
priest "stripped off his gown and took up a wallet-full of
books," declaring, "that as often as he had entered magic
circles, nothing so extraordinary had ever happened to him!"
How is it, in the language of professor Beckman, that "in
all periods of the world, priests have acted as jugglers to
simple and ignorant people?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>This same Benvenuto Celini, however, was a man of intelligence.
He wrote a work called the <cite>History of Jewelry</cite>;
in which the first idea of phosphorescent mineral bodies is to
be found. This work was written in the beginning of the
16th century. His life, although singularly marked, what
with popes, priests, artists, and necromancers, presents a
singular retrospect.</p>

<p>What was more absurd, and even profane, than the tricks
of Joseph Balsamo, called Il Conte Cagliostro, who with
Schœpfer, revived the study of the magical arts; and who
with invocations, friction, fumigations, and optical deceptions
astonished the ignorant of their day. Whether like
Æneas, in his descent to hell, they made their way with
their falchions through crowds of ghosts, or like Dioscorides,
relied on the efficacy of herbs, or like Paracelsus,
carried an evil spirit in their canes, or wore a <i>jewel</i> like
Shakspeare's toad, which possessed marvellous virtues, or
employed the magic stone (<i>agate</i>) of the east, and invoked
their <i>urim and thummim</i>,&mdash;it is certain they worked upon the
imagination of the people. By the application of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conium
maculatum</i>, (hemlock) consisted the ceremony of ordaining
a Hierophant; by the hartshorn of Orpheus, they had a divine
remedy for the passions of the body; and by a mixture of
<i>new mustard and olive oil</i>, they could produce a symphony,
which invoked the spirits, and, Pythonesis like, declare to
the people, that they "<i>had devils in their bellies</i>!!"</p>

<p>Of the phial of Cagliostro, Cardan relates that he had this
phial twice exhibited to him, and complains bitterly of having
seen nothing, after the anthem <i>Sancte Michael</i>, but some
bubbles that issued from the bottom, though it was believed
that these bubbles were angels! He says, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nihil tamen omnino
vidi poste hanc invocationem nisi bulas pauculas quasdam
ex imo gutti fundo exæstuantes</i>." Aulus Gellius and Hero
mention tricks of this kind practised by the Egyptians. Roger
Bacon, the alchymist, was excommunicated by the pope,
and imprisoned ten years, for supposed dealings with the
devil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Equally absurd to a man of reflection, are the observations
of antiquated writers on spontaneous generation, by heat.
Borello (<cite>Physical History</cite>) tells us, "that fresh water craw
fish may be regenerated, by their own powder, calcined in a
crucible, then boiled in water with a little sand, and left to
cool, for a few days; when the animalcula will appear swimming
merrily in the liquor, and must be then nourished with
beef blood, till they attain the proper size to stock your
ponds with."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The Sieur Pogeris and M. de Chamberlan,
both agree with Signior Borello, but, in the chemistry of the
matter, they add that the operation must be performed, <i>during
the full of the moon!</i> If this <i>lunar system</i> be adopted,
would not the <i>crab</i> also, have been a more favourable <i>sign</i>
to have ruled the nativity of <i>craw fish</i>?</p>

<p>Swift, however, alludes to these agencies, fallacious as
they are, in the following lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"So <i>chymists</i> boast they have a power,</p>
<p class="verse">"From the dead ashes of a flower,</p>
<p class="verse">"Some faint resemblance to produce,</p>
<p class="verse">"But not the virtue, taste, or juice."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Rochos, equally absurd with Borello, says, in <cite>The Art of
Nature</cite>, that the ashes of <i>toads</i> will produce the very same
effect, as the powder of <i>crabs' eyes</i>! Reasoning upon that
ridiculous and unnatural principle of Cæsalpinus, in his
comment on Aristotle, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quæcumque ex semine fiunt, eadem
fieri posse sine semine</i>, the procreation of eels from rye-meal,
or mutton broth was predicated.</p>

<p><i>Julius Camillus</i>, however, would out-do nature herself;
for <i>Amatus Lusitanus</i> affirms, that he has seen his phials
full of <i>homunculi</i> complete in all their parts! Paracelsus
(<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Rerum Natura</cite>,) had the same and many other absurd
notions. What, we may truly say, has not been palmed upon
the world, when we are told, that the following translation
from a Hague Gazette, which appeared in the <cite>British Evening
Post</cite>, No. 1645, contained facts, which were confidently
believed by the ignorant:</p>

<p>"Mr. <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Tunesteick'">Tunestrick</ins>, by origin an Englishman, has just exhibited
at Versailles, a very singular experiment. He opened
the head of a sheep, and a horse from side to side, by driving
a large iron wedge into the skull, by means of a mallet; drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the wedge out afterwards, with pincers, and recalled the
animals to life, by injecting through their exterior aperture
with a tin syringe, a spirituous liquor of his own composition,
to which he attributes surprising effects! The taste of
this liquor resembles that of <i>Commandus Balm</i>!!" The remarkable
effects of galvanism, however, are well authenticated;
but <i>resuscitation</i>, notwithstanding all apparent life, has in
no instance, to our knowledge, been effected. (See Ure's
<cite>Chemical Dictionary</cite>, article Galvanism.)</p>

<p>Among other tricks, we may mention those with serpents,
especially in the East Indies, and neighbouring islands, where
a certain class of people exhibit them for money.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Persons who could walk over red-hot coals, or red-hot
iron, or who could hold them in their hands and their teeth,
are frequently mentioned. In the end of the 17th century,
Richardson, an Englishman, was a great adept in this performance.
We are assured he could chew burning coals, pour
melted lead upon his tongue, swallow melted glass, &amp;c; but
the fact is incredible.</p>

<p>It is true, that the skin may be prepared in such a way as to
become callous and insensible against the impression made
on the feet and hands. It may be rendered as firm as shoes
and gloves. Such callosity may be produced, if the skin is
continually compressed, singed, pricked, or injured in any
other manner. Beckman relates, that in 1765, he visited
the copper-works at Awestad, when one of the workmen,
for some money, took some of the melted copper in his
hand, and after showing it, threw it against a wall. He performed
a variety of other experiments with the melted
metal.</p>

<p>The workmen at the Swedish melting-house have exhibited
the same thing to some travellers in the 17th century. The
skin is first rendered callous by frequently moistening it, as
Beckman says, with sulphuric acid; and also, he remarks, by
using the juice of certain plants. The skin must also be
rubbed frequently, and for a long time, with oil. Haller, in
his <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Elementa Physiologica</cite>, V. p. 16, speaks of this fact.</p>

<p>The manner of rendering the hands callous, or insensible,
so that they may take up, and hold, ignited iron, charcoal,
or other substances, may be seen in an English publication
of 1667. The <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal des Savants</cite>, of 1677, contains the
secret. "It consists in applying to the hands, various pastes,
with spirits of sulphur, (sulphuric acid,) which destroys the
epidermis, &amp;c. and the nervous energy." This corroborates
the account by Beckman. We read that Richardson had
prepared his tongue in such a manner, that he could hold
on the point of it a live coal, covering it first with pitch,
rosin, and sulphur, and could hold a piece of ignited iron
between his teeth. After showing the coal on his tongue,
he would then extinguish it in his mouth. The <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires de
l'Académie</cite> state, that a person who is salivated can put a live
coal in his mouth. The <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire de l'Industrie</cite> observes,
that the sulphur diminishes the heat of the coal, for the flame
is less hot than a candle; and that the flame of a combination
of pitch, rosin, and sulphur, is still less hot, and by no
means so considerable as we would imagine. In the expe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>riment,
the rosin is not melted, and the flame of the sulphur
is inconsiderable. M. Gallois observes, that he witnessed
in the Swedish iron founderies, the men hold melted cast
iron in their hands, doubtless having them previously prepared.</p>

<p>The traces of this art may be found in the works of the
ancients. A festival was held annually, on Mount Soracta,
in Etruria, at which the Hirpi, who lived not far from Rome,
jumped through burning coals, and on this account had certain
privileges granted them by the Roman Senate.</p>

<p>Women also, we are informed, were accustomed to walk
over burning coals, at Cartabola, in Cappadocia, near the
temple dedicated to Diana. Servius remarks, that the Hirpi
did not trust to their sanctity so much as they did to the
preparation of their feet for the operation!</p>

<p>With respect to the ordeal by fire, which it seems was
performed in several ways, one was, that when persons were
accused, they were obliged to prove their innocence by holding
in their hands red-hot iron. This mode of exculpation,
as it is called, was allowed only to weak persons, who were
unfit to wield arms, and particularly to monks and ecclesiastics,
to whom, for the sake of their security, the trial by
single combat was forbidden. In Grupius' learned dissertation,
in the German, p. 679, as quoted by Beckman, we
read, that the trial itself took place in the church, under the
inspection of the clergy; mass was celebrated at the same
time; the defendant and the iron, were consecrated, by
being sprinkled with holy water; the clergy made the iron
hot themselves; and they used all these preparations, as
jugglers do many motions, only to divert the attention of
the spectators. It was necessary that the accused person
should remain at least three days and three nights, under
their immediate care, and continue as long after. They covered
their hands both before and after the proof; sealed and
unsealed the covering: the former, as they pretended, to
prevent the hands from being prepared by art; and the latter
to see if they were burnt.</p>

<p>Some artificial preparation was undoubtedly necessary, or
why prescribe three days for the defendant, who, if they
wished to make him appear innocent, had a certain preventive
against the actual cautery? The three days allotted,
after the trial, were requisite, in order to restore the hands
to their natural state. The sacred sealing secured them
from the examination of presumptuous unbelievers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>When the ordeal was abolished, it no longer was kept secret.
In the 13th century, an account of it was published by a Dominican
Monk, Albertus Magnus. In the work of this author,
entitled, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Mirabilibus Mundi</cite>, he has given the receipt for
the composition. It seems that it consisted in covering the
hands with a kind of paste, and not by searing them. The
sap of the althæa, or marsh mallow, the mucilaginous seeds
of the fleabane, together with the white of an egg, were
mixed, and by applying this mixture, the hands were as safe
as if they had been secured by gloves. The use of this
mixture, for the same purpose, may be traced back, it is said,
to a pagan origin. In the Antigone of Sophocles, the guards,
placed over the body of Polynicus, which had been carried
away and buried, contrary to the orders of Creon, offered, in
order to prove their innocence, to submit to any trial: "We
will," said they, "take up red-hot iron in our hands, or
walk through fire."</p>

<p>The ordeal, by heated ploughshares, was common in
England. It seems, according to English History, that
queen Emma had charges preferred against her, by Robert,
archbishop of Canterbury, for consenting to the death of her
son Alfred, and preparing poison for her son Edward, the
Confessor. She claimed, by the law of the land, the ordeal,
or trial, by burning ploughshares. She passed the nine ploughshares
unhurt, which established her innocence, and caused
the archbishop to fly the kingdom. The chief trials, by
ordeal, appear to have been by fire, water, walking blindfold
among heated ploughshares, and swallowing consecrated
bread, which last was introduced about the time of pope
Eugene. The custom was borrowed from the Mosaic law.
An example of its practice occurs in the New Testament, in
the story of Ananias and Sapphira; and the remembrance of
it, as Blackstone remarks, still subsists among common people,
as "<i>May this morsel be my last</i>;" "<i>May I be choked
if it is so</i>," <i>and the like</i>; for it appears, that this ordeal was
a piece of bread of about an ounce in weight, blessed by the
priest, and given to the accused person, who was to try and
swallow it, praying that it might choke him if he were
guilty. The bible-ordeal, and the drowning-ordeal, are
familiar to every one, degrading as they all must have been
to human reason, and enlightened principles. Fox, in his
<cite>Book of Martyrs</cite>, speaks of various ordeals, as well as the
cruel deaths, and inhuman punishments inflicted, by the
hand of bigotry, and fanaticism, under the cloak of religion,
which were nothing more than a base and impious prostitution
of its genuine principles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Even among the modern Greeks, the same superstitious
notions prevail. Almost every cavern about Athens has its
particular virtues, and is celebrated for various things; and
the offerings, made by Grecian women, to the <i>destinies</i>, in
order to make them propitious to their conjugal speculations,
are equally absurd. These offerings, by which they are to
work a miracle, consist of a cup of honey and white almonds,
a cake on a little napkin, and a <i>vase of aromatic herbs, burning
and exhaling an agreeable perfume</i>. We are told, however,
that those evil spirits, whose assistance is invoked, for
vengeance and blood, are not regaled upon cakes and honey,
but on a piece of a priest's cap, or a rag from his garment,
which are considered as the most favourable ingredients for
the perpetration of malice and revenge. When a person is
<i>hated</i>, another absurd custom is used, which is supposed to
be followed by dreadful results. It consists in placing before
his door, a log of wood, burnt at one end, with some hairs
twisted round it. "This curse," says Mr. Dodwell, in his
<cite>Classical Tour</cite>, "was placed with due solemnity, at the door
of the English agent, Speridion Logotheti, while I was at
Athens; but he rendered it of no avail, by summoning a
great number of priests, who easily destroyed the spell, by
benediction, frankincense, and holy water!" This story is
much in character with that of the exorcism of rats, caterpillars,
flies, and other insects, an old ritual of the papal
church, performed between the feasts of Easter and the
Ascension. A priest who resided at Bononia, performed
the ceremony. "I went," he says, "to exorcise the insects
in that country, accompanied by a curate, who was a droll
fellow, and laughed at the credulity of the people, while he
pocketed their money." It appears, however, that in all
superstitious ceremonies, <i>fire</i>, under some form, was a pre-requisite;
but <i>ecclesiastical fire-works</i> we leave within the
pales of the priesthood.</p>

<p>The author of the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire de l'Industrie</cite>, vol. iii,
speaks of a trick, performed with a loaded musket and
ball, which, although apparently inconsistent, is nevertheless
true, if we consider the action of gunpowder equal. This
<i>trick</i> is stated to be the firing of a musket, loaded with ball,
at a person, without wounding, or in any way injuring him.</p>

<p>By taking a ball of solid lead of a smaller size than the
calibre of the musket, and placing it on the charge in a gun,
and as much or nearly so of powder, <i>over the ball</i>, the effect
we are assured is, that when the gun is fired, the ball
will pass out without any very sensible force, and even drop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
a few yards from the gun, although the report will be as
great as if the charge and ball had been used in the usual
manner. This trick is often performed by jugglers, to the
great astonishment of the spectators. The mode of <i>catching
a cannon ball</i> is also of the same character.</p>

<p>The proper charge of powder for the cannon, is divided
into two unequal portions, the lesser of which is placed in
the gun as a charge; the ball is placed on it in the usual
way, and the rest of the powder (by much the greater portion,)
placed over the ball, the lesser quantity being not
more than a twelfth part of the whole. A cannon, so charged,
will not project the ball more than 20 yards, where it might
be caught with safety.</p>

<p>Any person who has been in the custom of shooting, must
have frequently observed, that when the shot happens to be
mixed with the powder, its range is impeded; and, under
similar circumstances, they have even been found only a few
yards from the muzzle of the piece. This fact I have witnessed,
although I confess I never once reflected on it.</p>

<p>As to the explanation of this phenomenon, it appears, that
it can only be accounted for by referring to the action of two
opposite forces, mutually repelling each other, added to that
of the charge under the ball; hence, the <i>reaction</i> would be
equal, if, under the same circumstances, both charges were
alike situated: but the effect of the first charge is so much
weakened by the counter effect of the second, that the projectile
force of the ball becomes comparatively nothing.</p>

<p>There is another trick very often performed, which, however
chemical, is not looked upon in that light, neither do
performers attempt to explain it; we mean the exhibition of
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Glace Inflammable</i> of the French.</p>

<p>The preparation is made in the following manner: melt
some spermaceti over a fire, and add a sufficient quantity of
spirit of turpentine, and blend them together. The mixture
when cold, will become solid, having somewhat the appearance
of ice. If made in hot weather, the vessel containing
the melted substances must be immersed in cold water. It
does not, we are told, remain in a solid state any length of
time.</p>

<p>It floats more or less in the fluid, which of course is the
spirit of turpentine. The trick, with this preparation, after
having put some of the solid and fluid substance together
on a plate, is to pour upon it concentrated nitric acid, or a
mixture of eight or ten parts of nitric acid, and two of sulphuric
acid; inflammation ensues. It is no other in fact than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
accension of the oil of turpentine; the addition of the spermaceti
is altogether secondary, and its effect, if any, must
retard instead of promoting the combustion of the turpentine.
The art of making this preparation is in rendering the
essential oil solid and transparent, without altering its inflammable
properties.</p>

<p>There is another trick performed, by burning a thread, to
which an ear-ring is tied, and which, notwithstanding the
thread is reduced to a cinder, still holds the ring. This is
what the French call the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bague suspendue aux cendres d'un
fil</i>. The string is first prepared by soaking it for 24 hours,
in a solution of common salt, and drying it; then tying it to
a ring, and setting it on fire, avoiding any vibration or oscillation
of the string. It is obvious that the salt serves to
render the cinder cohesive.</p>

<p>We have an account in Maundrel's <cite>Travels from Aleppo
to Jerusalem</cite>, of the office of the <i>Holy Fire</i>. The ceremony
is kept up by the Greeks and Armenians, from a persuasion
that every Easter eve, a miraculous flame descends from
heaven into the holy sepulchre, and lights all the lamps and
candles, as the sacrifice was consumed at the prayers of
Elijah.</p>

<p>"On our approaching the holy sepulchre," says Maundrel,
"we found it crowded with a numerous and distracted mob,
who made a hideous clamour; but with some difficulty pressing
through the crowd, we got up in the gallery next to the
Latin convent, where we could have a view of all that passed.
The people began, by running with all their might, round
the holy sepulchre, crying out 'huia,' which signifies, '<i>This
is he</i>,' or, '<i>This is it</i>.' After this, they began to perform
many antic tricks: sometimes they dragged one another along
the floor round the sepulchre; sometimes marched round
with a man upright upon another's shoulders; at others, took
men with their heels upwards, and hurried them about with
such indecency, as to expose their nudities; and sometimes
they tumbled round the sepulchre like tumblers on a stage. In
a word, nothing can be imagined more rude and extravagant
than what was acted upon this occasion.</p>

<p>"This frantic humour continued from twelve till four, and
then the Greeks first set out in a procession round the sepulchre,
followed by the Armenians, and marched three times
round it with their standards, streamers, crucifixes, and embroidered
habits; and towards the end of the procession, a
pidgeon came fluttering into the cupola over the sepulchre,
at which the people redoubled their shouts and clamours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>,
when the Latins told the English gentlemen, that this bird
was let fly by the Greeks, to deceive the people with a belief
that it was a visible descent of the Holy Ghost. The
procession being over, the suffragan of the Greek patriarch,
and the principal Armenian bishop, approached the door of
the sepulchre, cut the string with which it was fastened, and
breaking the seal, entered, shutting the door after them, all
the candles and lamps within having been before extinguished
in the presence of the Turks. As the accomplishment of the
miracle drew near, the exclamations were redoubled, and
the people pressed with such violence towards the door, that
the Turks could not keep them off with the severest blows.
This pressing forward was occasioned by the desire to light
their candles at the holy flame as soon as it was brought out
of the sepulchre. The two miracle-mongers had not been
above a minute in the sepulchre, when the glimmering of the
holy fire was seen through some chinks in the door, which
made the mob as mad as any in bedlam; then presently
came out the priests, with blazing torches in their hands,
which they held up at the door of the sepulchre, while the
people thronged with extraordinary zeal to obtain a part of
the first and purest flame, though the Turks laid on with
their clubs without mercy. Those who got the fire immediately
applied it to their beards, faces, and bosoms, pretending
that it would not burn like an earthly flame; but none of
them would endure the experiment long enough to make
good that pretension. However, so many tapers were presently
lighted, that the whole church seemed in a blaze, and
this illumination concluded the ceremony."</p>

<p>Maundrel afterwards observes, that the Latins take great
pains to expose this ceremony as a shameful imposition, and
a scandal to the Christian Religion: but the Greeks and Armenians,
lay such stress upon it, that they make the pilgrimages
chiefly on this account; and their priests have
acted the cheat so long, that they are forced now to stand
to it, for fear of endangering the apostacy of the people.
They entertain many absurd ideas respecting the miraculous
power of the holy fire. Even the melted wax of the candle,
which had been lighted by it, is covered over with linen, and
designed for winding-sheets; "for they imagine," says Maundrel,
"that if they are buried in a shroud, smutted with this
celestial fire, it will secure them from the flames of hell!"</p>

<p>Before concluding this article, we shall mention a subject
highly interesting in optics, which, in some of its forms, was
employed by the old magicians; we mean the phantasmagoria.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
The exhibitions of this kind, when first got up, drew the attention
of Europeans, and particularly the French, who
greatly improved the apparatus and machinery, and varied
the forms and appearances. The principles of the phantasmagoria
are described in every work on Natural Philosophy,
which treats of optics. The <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire de l'Industrie</cite>,
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Encyclopedie Méthodique</cite>, Biot's <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de Physique</cite>, in
French and in English, the different treatises on philosophy
and optics, particularly Dr. Smith's, the Cyclopedias, &amp;c.
contain either a description, or the principles of it. The
third volume of Biot, especially, is full on the subject of
optics. With regard, however, to the narrative and explanation
of the appearance of the phantoms, and other figures,
a subject which immediately concerns us, the account given
by Mr. Nicholson, (<cite>Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chymistry,
and the Arts</cite>, vol. i, p. 147.) is the most interesting.
Connected with this optical illusion, is the imitation of
lightning and thunder, which, from the account, appears also
to have been performed.</p>

<p><a name="PHAx" id="PHAx"></a>The phantasmagoria may be considered nothing more than
an application of the magic lantern, the invention of which
is attributed to Roger Bacon, who was a contemporary with
Vitellio, a native of Poland, who published a treatise on
optics, in 1270. John Babtista Porta, of Naples, who
discovered the camera obscura, having formed a society
of ingenious persons at Naples, which he called the Academy
of Secrets, wrote the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magia Naturalis</cite>, containing
his account of this instrument, and, it is said, the first
hint of the magic lantern. Kircher, it is known, received
his first information of the magic lantern from this book,
and afterwards improved it.</p>

<p>Adams (<cite>Lectures on Natural and Experimental Philosophy</cite>,
vol. ii, p. 232. Appendix by the English editor) very
justly observes, that persons, unacquainted with the principles
of optics, have been surprised at the great illusion
of their sight, by an artificial construction of many optical
instruments, exhibited by showmen and others: such, for
instance, as the optical and dioptrical paradox; the endless
gallery; the animated balls by simple reflection; phantoms;
causing the appearance of a flower from its ashes; the
optical perspective box, and the cylindrical mirror: to which
we may add, the enchanted bottle; the enchanted palace; the
magic lantern; the magician's mirror; the perspective mirror;
the camera obscura; distorting and oracular mirror; the
diagonal opera glass, &amp;c. &amp;c.; all which may be seen in
Smith's <cite>School of Arts</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>We may also remark, that optical exhibitions sometimes
accompany those of fire, when performed on a small scale.
In the phantasmagoria, for instance, whether before, or at
the time the exhibition commences, as well as after, thunder
and lightning, if well imitated, produces a good effect.</p>

<p>The mechanism of the phantasmagoria is concealed from the
spectators, who have only before their eyes a screen of gauze
or gummed muslin posited vertically, which serves as the
ground of a picture, where the images are depicted by reason
of the transparency. The apartment is deprived of all light,
except that which proceeds from an apparatus hid behind the
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'skreen'">screen</ins>. At the moment when the operation commences, a
spectre appears (as a skeleton, the head of a celebrated
person, &amp;c.), at first extremely small, but which afterwards
increases rapidly, and thus seems to advance at a great rate
towards the spectators. And when the scene passes before
them in a room representing a cave hung with black, a solemn
silence being occasionally interrupted by mournful sounds
from an appropriate musical instrument, it is not easy for an
observer to defend himself from the impression of terror, at
the sight of an object, in itself formed to produce the illusion,
and which finds in the imagination a place already prepared
for the reception of phantoms.</p>

<p>The instrument placed behind the gauze screen is in fact
a peculiar construction of the magic lantern: only in the former,
it is necessary that the lenses should run over a much
greater space, and that the instrument may be susceptible of
approaching to, and receding from, the frame of gauze, in
such manner, that each luminous pencil may be depicted
there in a single point. The general construction is this: In
a square box, a lamp is placed, the luminous rays proceeding
from which, are reflected by a conical mirror, towards an orifice
made in the box. At this orifice is placed a tube, blackened
within, and composed of several tubes which slide one
into another, like those of a pocket telescope. This tube is
furnished with two bi-convex lenses of about five inches diameter;
one of these is fixed, the other is at the outer extremity
of the tube, and is separated from the former in proportion as
the tube is lengthened by the aid of a hooked lever situated
along the tube, between the lamp and the lenses. A groove
is properly adapted to the tube, destined to receive transparent
figures; lastly, the box rests upon a table moveable on
four wheels, that slide in two channels perpendicularly to the
frame on which the images are depicted. It is manifest, that
we may augment or diminish the dimensions of the images,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and consequently make the spectre appear more or less near
to the spectator, by separating farther, or by bringing nearer
together, the two lenses; but then the focus of the diverging
rays, which proceed from the same point of the transparent
body, will be no longer upon the screen; we must, therefore,
cause the machine so to recede or approach, that the two motions,
being duly combined, the image may be distinctly
formed.</p>

<p>These phantasmagoria are furnished with a great number
of transparencies, in each of which, several changes may be
made by slackening their springs. Thus we may change at
every instant, the form, the magnitude, and the distance of
the spectres, as they appear to the spectator.</p>

<p>What has been said hitherto, relates only to the images of
transparent figures. To obtain those of opaque bodies, first
place the gauze and box, at the distance of about six feet one
from the other, and adapt to the orifice of the box, an apparatus
of two tubes furnished with two bi-convex lenses. An
opaque body, such, for example, as a medal, or a picture, is
attached to a little support, posited in the middle of the box;
the lamp with its supply of air, situated in one of the foremost
corners of the box, illuminates that object, and the reflected
rays, crossing the lenses, proceed till they trace the
image upon the gauze, with an amplification which is in the
ratio of the distances.</p>

<p>If the image be not distinct, we must infer that it is not at
the focus; but it may be adjusted in three different ways; 1.
By moving the box to or from the gauze; 2. By moving the
object nearer to, or farther from, the lenses within the box; 3.
By slowly moving the tubes, to cause a variation in the distance
between the lenses.&mdash;See Haüy's <cite>Philosophy</cite>, translated
by Gregory, vol. ii, p. 390.</p>

<p>Mr. Nicholson, however, witnessed an exhibition of the
phantasmagoria at the London Lyceum by Philipstal, who
took out a patent for his improvements in the apparatus and
machinery. He observes, that the novelty consists in placing
the lantern on the opposite side of the screen which receives
the images, instead of on the same side as the spectator, and
suffering no light to appear but what passes through, and
tends to form those images. His sliders are therefore perfectly
opaque, except that portion upon which the transparent
figures are drawn, and the exhibition is thus conducted.</p>

<p>All the lights of the small theatre of exhibition were removed,
except one hanging lamp, which could be drawn up,
so that its flame should be perfectly enveloped in a cylindrical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
chimney, or opaque shade. In this gloomy and wavering
light, the curtain was drawn up, and presented to the spectator
a cave or place exhibiting skeletons, and other figures or
terror, in relief, and painted on the sides or walls. After a
short interval, the lamp was drawn up, and the audience were
in total darkness, succeeded by thunder and lightning; which
last appearance was formed by the magic lantern upon a thin
cloth or screen, let down after the disappearance of the light,
and consequently unknown to most of the spectators. These
appearances were followed by figures of departed men, ghosts,
skeletons, transmutations, &amp;c. produced on the screen by the
magic lantern on the other side, and moving their eyes,
mouth, &amp;c. by the well known contrivance of two or more
sliders. The transformations are effected by moving the adjusting
tube of the lantern out of focus, and changing the
slider during the moment of the confused appearance.</p>

<p>It must be again remarked, that these figures appear without
any surrounding circle of illumination, and that the spectators,
having no previous view or knowledge of the screen,
nor any visible object of comparison, are each left to imagine
the distance according to their respective fancy. After a very
short time of exhibiting the first figure, it was seen to contract
gradually in all its dimensions, until it became extremely
small, and then vanished. This effect, as may easily be imagined,
is produced by bringing the lantern nearer and nearer
the screen, taking care at the same time to preserve the distinctness,
and at last closing the aperture altogether: and the
process being (except as to brightness) exactly the same as
happens when visible objects become more remote, the mind
is irresistibly led to consider the figures, as if they were receding
to an immense distance.</p>

<p>Several figures of celebrated men were thus exhibited with
some transformations; such as the head of Dr. Franklin being
converted into a skull, and these were succeeded by phantoms,
skeletons, and various terrific figures, which instead of
seeming to recede and then vanish, were (by enlargement)
made suddenly to advance; to the surprise and astonishment
of the audience, and then disappear by seeming to sink into
the ground.</p>

<p>This part of the exhibition, which by the agitation of the
spectators appeared to be much the most impressive, had less
effect with me than the receding of the figures; doubtless because
it was more easy for me to imagine the screen to be
withdrawn than brought forward. But among the young people
who were with me, the judgments were various. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
thought they could have touched the figures, others had a
different notion of their distance, and a few apprehended
that they had not advanced beyond the first row of the audience.</p>

<p>The whole, as well as certain mechanical inventions, were
managed with dexterity and address. The lightning, being
produced by the camera, was tame, and had not the brisk transient
appearance of the lightning at the theatres, which is
produced by rosin, or lycopodium powder, thrown through a
light, which in Mr. P's utter darkness might easily have
been concealed in a kind of dark lantern.</p>

<p>A plate of thin sheet iron, such as German stoves are made
of, is an excellent instrument for producing the noise of thunder.
It may be three or four feet long, and the usual width.
When this plate is held between the finger and thumb by one
corner, and suffered to hang at liberty, if the hand be then
moved or shaken horizontally, so as to agitate the corner at
right angles to the surface, a great variety of sounds will be
produced; from the low rumbling swell of distant thunder, to
the succession of loud explosive bursts of thunder from elevated
clouds. This simple instrument is very manageable,
so that the operator soon feels his power of producing whatever
character of sound he may desire; and notwithstanding
this description may seem extravagant, whoever tries it for
the first time will be surprised at the resemblance. If the
plate be too small, the sound will be short, acute, and metallic.</p>

<p>We may remark also, that the magic lantern, by new contrived
sliders and machinery, may be applied to important
uses, by employing it with such figures as will explain the
general principles of optics, astronomy, botany, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The experiment mentioned by Ferguson, with a concave
mirror, reflecting into the air the appearance of fire, &amp;c. into
a focal point, (founded on a general principle of concave reflectors,)
is productive of many agreeable deceptions, and
which exhibited with art and an air of mystery, has been
very successfully employed.</p>

<p>The phantasmascope of Walker is similar to the phantasmagoria.
It is an optical machine, which presents a door that
opens itself. The apparatus is so contrived, that, on opening
the door, a phantom makes its appearance, having all the colours
of a picture, which approaches the spectator. Various
figures may be accurately represented.</p>

<p>We will not enlarge on this subject, although many other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
instances of tricks, performed by means of fire, &amp;c. might
be noticed. We will merely remark:</p>

<p>1. For the performance of these exhibitions, the ancient,
as well as the modern jugglers, of <i>all</i> descriptions, employed,
and were acquainted with sundry mixtures, and compositions,
by the use of which, they deceived the people; and some
pretended to possess supernatural agencies. Of these compositions,
with many of which we are unacquainted, we have
enumerated some, and their effects. That of producing a
callosity of the skin, &amp;c. by means of acids, is an example.</p>

<p>2. That they possessed, as a trade or profession, the arts
of deception. Not only by the use of chemical preparations,
but by other means, they pretended to work miracles in the
dark ages of science. However degraded these persons
may seem, they yield in vice to another class, who practised
the art of poisoning, and who kept it so profound a
secret, that few then understood the effect of the now common,
vegetable, and mineral poisons. Who could have been
more infamous than the celebrated female poisoner, Tophania?</p>

<p class="pfs70">OF THE SUBSTANCES USED IN THE FORMATION OF FIRE-WORKS.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="NITw" id="NITw"></a><i>Sect. I. Of Nitrate of Potassa, or Saltpetre.</i></p>

<p>Nitrate of potassa, nitre, or saltpetre, is composed, as its
name expresses, of nitric acid, and potassa. When pure, it
contains, according to Kirwan, potassa 51.8, nitric acid 44,
and water 4.2 in the hundred. This salt, when pure, or
even mixed with other saline substances, is recognised by
placing it on hot coals. Slight detonations, and a hissing noise,
with a vivid combustion take place. It is also decomposed
by sulphuric acid, and the nitrous vapour is apparent from
its smell and colour.</p>

<p>Nitrate of potassa crystallises in six-sided prisms, terminated
by six-sided pyramids. Its specific gravity is 1.933.
Its taste is sharp and cooling. One part is soluble in seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
parts of water, at the temperature of 60 degrees, and in
rather less than its own weight of boiling water.</p>

<p>It melts in a strong heat, and by cooling congeals into an
opaque mass, called <i>crystal mineral</i>, or <i>sal prunelle</i>.</p>

<p>Exposed to a red heat, it disengages <i>oxygen gas</i>, and
passes to the state of a nitrate; at a higher temperature, this
is decomposed, and oxygen, azote, and a portion of nitrous
acid, which has not been decomposed, are evolved. What
remains is potassa. When projected on ignited coals, it burns
brilliantly. Detonation also ensues by mixing nitre and
charcoal, and throwing the mixture into a red-hot crucible.
The residuum is carbonate of potassa. Fourcroy (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Système
des Connoissances Chimiques</cite>, Tome iii, p. 124.) observes,
that metals, with nitrate of potassa, will decompose this salt,
and produce different coloured flame, extremely brilliant, on
which account such substances are used in fire-works.</p>

<p>The alchymists believed, they could obtain, from nitre, a
liquor, which would constitute, with other substances, the
<i>philosopher's stone</i>. The <i>clyssus</i> of nitre, they imagined,
possessed wonderful properties. The decomposition of nitre
by charcoal, they effected in two ways, <i>viz.</i> by submitting
the mixture to the action of heat in a crucible, or, otherwise
in an earthen or iron retort. In the latter case, they collected
a fluid, principally water, containing some carbonic acid,
and the aeriform product they suffered to escape. The residue
they named <i>nitre fixed by charcoal</i>, or, <i>the extemporaneous
alkali of nitre</i>. When, in the place of charcoal, a mixture
of sulphur and nitre was projected into a red-hot crucible,
they obtained a saline substance, to which they gave
the name of <i>sal polychrest</i>. This is the same as vitriolated
tartar, or sulphate of potassa, and is that salt which is formed
in the distillation of nitric acid from nitre, and sulphuric
acid. The <i>crystal mineral</i>, of some of the old pharmacopœias,
was nothing more than nitrate of potassa fused with
a portion of sulphur, and, therefore, a mixed salt, consisting
of nitrate and sulphate of potassa.</p>

<p>Nitrate of potassa, distilled with half its weight of sulphuric
acid, furnishes nitric acid, or concentrated spirit of
nitre. This, diluted with about an equal weight of water,
forms the <i>aqua fortis</i> of the shops.</p>

<p>A mixture of nitre and phosphorus, if struck with a hammer,
produces a violent detonation. Nitre oxidizes all the
metals at a red heat, even gold and platinum.</p>

<p>Nitre and sulphur, thrown into a red-hot crucible, produces
an instantaneous combustion, accompanied with a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
disengagement of light and heat. Sulphurous acid gas, with
sulphuric acid, is produced.</p>

<p>Equal parts of cream of tartar, (supertartrate of potassa,)
and nitre, deflagrated in a crucible, form <i>white flux</i>. Two
parts of tartar, and one of nitre, treated in the same manner,
produce <i>black flux</i>.</p>

<p>Three parts of nitre, one part of sulphur, and one part of
sawdust, mixed together, form the <i>powder of fusion</i>.</p>

<p><a name="INFx" id="INFx"></a><a name="FULy" id="FULy"></a>
When three parts of nitre, two parts of potash, and one
of sulphur, all previously well dried, are mixed together, the
compound is called <i>pulvis fulminans</i>, or, <i>fulminating powder</i>.
A small portion of this powder, or as much as will lay on a
shilling-piece, put on a shovel, and exposed to heat, will first
melt, become liver-coloured, and then explode with great
noise. The theory of this explosion is, that a part of the sulphur,
and the potassa unite, and form a sulphuret; the sulphuret
then decomposes water, and produces sulphuretted hydrogen
gas, which appears to be decomposed by the nitric acid; and
there results sulphurous acid gas, water, and, as Thenard
observes, protoxide of azote, azotic gas, and sulphate of potassa.
The loudness of the report depends on the combustion
of the whole powder at the same instant, which is secured
by the previous fusion it undergoes. Gunpowder, on
the contrary, burns in succession, although apparently instantaneous.
In using common potash, there is also, as the alkali
contains it, carbonic acid, given out in the state of gas. In
fact carbonic acid appears to assist the explosive effect of this
powder, for when it is prepared with potash, containing
little carbonic acid, its detonating power is considerably less.</p>

<p><a name="INFy" id="INFy"></a>Nitre likewise enters into the composition of another fulminating
powder, invented by Dr. Higgins. <i>Higgins's fulminating
powder</i> is composed of three and a half parts of
nitre, two parts of crude antimony, and one part of sulphur.
This is used in the same manner as the former.</p>

<p>Nitre enters into the composition of gunpowder, which
we shall notice under a separate head. The proportions of
nitre, sulphur, and charcoal, for the formation of gunpowder,
which are considered the best, are, 75 parts of nitre, 12<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> of
charcoal, and 12<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> of sulphur.</p>

<p>The new powder of MM. Gengembrie and Bottée, which
inflames by percussion, but without explosion, is composed
of 21 parts of nitre, 54 parts of chlorate of potassa, 18 parts
of sulphur, and 7 parts of lycopodium.</p>

<p>A mixture of nitre and crude antimony projected into a
red-hot crucible, produces a deflagration more or less rapid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
forming a composition which is used in pharmacy, and medicine.</p>

<p>The quality of saltpetre may be determined by a variety
of experiments. Fire-workers judge of its quality by the
colour of its flame.</p>

<p>The flame should be white. If it be <i>green</i> or <i>yellow</i>, it is
said to be impure.</p>

<p><a name="NITz" id="NITz"></a>
Nitric acid, obtained by distilling saltpetre and sulphuric
acid, has a powerful effect on inflammable substances. If
nitric acid, or in preference, the fuming nitrous acid, be
poured on spirit of turpentine, especially if it be old, it will
inflame. To succeed, however, in this experiment, a small
portion of sulphuric acid is usually added to the nitric acid.
As this effect is owing to the facility, with which the acid
parts with its oxygen to inflammable bodies, other essential
oils, besides turpentine, will have the same effect. If the same
acid is poured on finely pulverized charcoal, or on lampblack,
combustion will also take place. When oils are used,
water as well as carbonic acid is produced, and when charcoal
or lampblack, carbonic acid alone. There is also a large
quantity of carbon, in the former instance, which remains on
the plate, or dish. M. Delametherie (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de Physique</cite>,
1815) has shown, that olive oil may be converted into a
substance, resembling, and having many of the properties of,
wax, by mixing it with a given proportion of nitric acid. The
acid is decomposed, deutoxide of azote is formed, and the
oil acquires a hard consistence. A candle made with this
artificial wax, he observes, burns with a clear light and without
smoke. The experiment with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">glace inflammable</i> is
on the same principle.</p>

<p>Morey (<cite>Silliman's Journal</cite>, vol. ii, p. 121.) states a singular
experiment, in which nitre is used; <i>viz</i>: If to tallow or linseed
oil, a small quantity of saltpetre be added, and the temperature
raised to nearly that of the boiling point, the saltpetre
appears to be dissolved by the oil; they will <i>evaporate
together</i>, and the mixture, or the vapour, will burn, <i>wholly
excluded from the atmosphere</i>.</p>

<p>Saltpetre was one of the substances employed by the alchemists.
It appears from the memoir of Geoffroy, (<cite>Coll. Academ.</cite>
1722,) that the object of the alchemists was twofold; the
transmutation of metals, and particularly what were denominated
the <i>baser</i> metals into the precious, which they pretended
to effect by a <i>universal spirit</i>, the <i>grand elixir</i>, the
<i>philosopher's stone</i>, &amp;c. and the reduction of metals to their
<i>earths</i>. Alchemy was introduced into Europe by the cru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>saders,
and it is remarkable, that, in the reign of Henry IV,
an act was passed to make it felony to transmute metals.
Mr. Boyle, aware of its absurdity, suggested the propriety
of repealing that act, which was done. One of their powders
was composed of nitre, cream of tartar, and sulphur.</p>

<p><i>Preparation.</i> Although nitrate of potassa is generated in
abundance, particularly in the East, yet in all countries,
where the circumstances are favourable to its production, it
is found. It never occurs, native, in very large masses. It
is generally found in an efflorescence, on the surface of the
soil, or in caverns. It never exists in the soil more than a
few yards beneath the surface. We may remark, that native
nitre has never been found in pure clay, or pure sand, except
in the <i>rock-ore</i>, as it is called, of the western United
States. It is often found in caverns, and fissures in calcareous
rocks.</p>

<p>In the East Indies, the districts which furnish saltpetre,
are swept at certain seasons of the year. This is repeated
two or three times a week; for the saltpetre again appears in
the same places, in the form of efflorescence.</p>

<p>It is supposed that some countries furnish saltpetre, in
consequence of the drought, which continues for some time.
At Lima, M. Dombay informs us, there is seldom rain; and
the fields, which serve as pasturage for beasts, are so much
covered with saltpetre, as to be removed with the spade.
There must then be a rapid formation of nitre. M. Talbot
observes, that in the meridional provinces of Spain, the earth
frequented by animals, contains it, ready formed. When
saltpetre became an article of importance, the rulers of Germany,
&amp;c. justified themselves in exclusively carrying away
the incrustations of walls from private houses, which, when
it could be used, became <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">accessorium fundi</i>. Accordingly this
<i>regale</i>, as it was called, was extended every where, and was
generally unpopular. In 1419, Gunther, archbishop of
Magdeburgh, issued the first grant, which was the right of
searching saltpetre and boiling it, during a year, in the district
of Gibicherstein, for which the person, to whom it was
granted, was to pay a barrel of saltpetre, and deliver to the
archbishop the remainder at a certain price.</p>

<p>The succeeding archbishop, Frederick, let, in 1460, to a
burgher of Halle, all the earth and saltpetre that could be
collected in the bailiwick of Gibicherstein, for four years, at
the annual rent of a given quantity of refined saltpetre.
Bishop Ernest, in 1477, let, for his time, the privilege of
collecting saltpetre. In 1544, saltpetre was collected, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
same manner, from the rubbish before the gates of Halle;
and in the year following, the magistrates of Halle erected a
powder mill, and had saltpetre works. John VI, archbishop
of Triers, granted similar privileges in 1560. The
saltpetre regale, was long known, and confirmed by a <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Bradenburgh'">Brandenburgh</ins>
decree in 1583.</p>

<p>Old walls, and the vicinity of stables, frequently exhibit
saltpetre in the state of efflorescence. It was the ancient <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scrophula
contra lapides</i>, represented as a kind of leprosy. For
the spontaneous production of nitre, animal and vegetable
substances, in a state of decomposition, and the presence of
dry atmospheric air are necessary. That lime, and the calcareous
carbonates also promote its formation, there can be no
doubt.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the large quantity of saltpetre collected
in the East Indies, we are told, that two-thirds of the whole
are annually sent into China, and other parts of Asia, to
make artificial fire-works. The pyrotechny of the Chinese
is said to be very perfect; in variety and beauty, some writers
assert they exceed all other nations. There is a natural
nitre bed at Apulia, near Naples, which affords 40 per centum
of nitre. Pelletier, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ann. de Chim.</cite> tome xxii.) has published an
analysis. The cavity of Molfetta is one hundred feet deep,
containing grottos or caverns. Nitrate of potassa is found in
the interior, in efflorescence or crusts, attached to compact
limestone. On removing these efflorescences, others appear.
The soil in this cavity is richly impregnated with nitre.</p>

<p>In Switzerland, the farmers extract an abundance of saltpetre
from the stalls under their cattle. During the American
revolution, when every expedient was resorted to, to obtain
a supply of this article, the floors of tobacco houses, &amp;c.
were dug up and lixiviated. In the reign of Charles the
First, certain patentees were authorised to dig up the floors
of all dove-houses, stables, &amp;c. the floors being again laid
with mellow earth.</p>

<p>The Ukraine, Podolia, Hungary, Spain, Italy, Peru, and
India, furnish more or less of this salt, which is extracted by
lixiviating the earths that compose the soil. The springs, in
particular districts of Hungary, contain it.</p>

<p>We are informed, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ann. de Chim.</cite> xx. 298,) that, during
the second and third years of the French Republic, the government
required every district to send two intelligent
young persons to Paris. This convocation, consisting of
nearly eleven hundred persons, received regular instruction
from their first chemists, partly concerning the manufacture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of cannon, and partly respecting the manufacture of saltpetre
and gunpowder. This body of pupils was afterwards distributed
among the different establishments in proportion to
their abilities, and saltpetre was soon furnished in abundance.</p>

<p>In the United States, we have an abundant source of saltpetre
in the <i>nitre caves</i> of the western country. There is now
no occasion for lixiviating the soil of tobacco houses, or of stables,
or the refuse of old buildings, the preparation of artificial
nitre beds, as adopted in France, or for any other expedient, to
furnish a supply of saltpetre; these caverns, which are calcareous,
producing it in great abundance. The <i>earth</i> of these caves
does not, however, contain pure nitrate of potassa, but generally
a mixture of this salt and nitrate of lime, a calcareous nitrate
which constitutes the principal part. The latter is changed
into nitrate of potassa, as we shall observe more particularly
hereafter, by making a lixivium of the earth in the usual
manner, and passing it through wood ashes. The alkali,
which the latter contains, decomposes the nitrate of lime, by
uniting with the nitric acid; hence the fluid, which passes
through, is nitrate of potassa or saltpetre. This is evaporated,
and suffered to crystallize. It is then the <i>crude, or rough nitre</i>,
which is purified, principally by re-solution, and crystallization.</p>

<p>The saltpetre makers, at the caves, have found, that two
bushels of ashes, made by burning the dry wood in hollow
trees, afford as much alkali as eighteen bushels of ashes obtained
from the oak. Notwithstanding the <i>nitre earth</i> contains
a mixture of the nitrates of potassa and lime, nitrate of
potassa, nearly pure, has been discovered. It is sometimes
found in the fissures of sandstone, or among detached fragments.
Some of these masses are said to weigh several hundred
pounds.</p>

<p>Besides these caverns, which have been accurately described
by Dr. Brown, in the Transactions of the <cite>American
Philosophical Society</cite>, (vol. v, vi.) similar caverns have been
discovered in Tennessee, and in some parts of Virginia and
Maryland. At Hughes' cave near Hagerstown, in Maryland,
this salt has also been made.</p>

<p>We are of opinion, that most of the calcareous caverns in
the United States, if carefully examined, might be found to
contain nitre, or at least, the calcareous nitrate, which is readily
converted into nitre by lixiviation with wood ashes, or
the addition of a due quantity of potash.</p>

<p>Professor Cleaveland, in noticing the saltpetre caves of the
western country, observes, (<cite>Elementary Treatise on Mineralogy
and Geology</cite>,) that one of the most remarkable of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
caverns is in Madison county, on Crooked Creek, about sixty
miles S. E. from Lexington. This cavern extends entirely
through a hill, and affords a convenient passage for horses
and wagons. Its length is six hundred and forty-six yards;
its breadth is generally about forty feet; and its average
height, about ten feet. One bushel of the earth of this cavern,
commonly yields from one to two pounds of nitre; and the
same salt has been found to exist, at the depth of at least fifteen
feet; even the clay, a fact which seems rather remarkable,
is impregnated with nitrate of lime. Kentucky also furnishes
native nitre under a very different form, and constituting
what is there called the <i>rock ore</i>, which is in fact a
sand stone, richly impregnated with nitrate of potassa. These
sand stones are generally situated at the head of narrow vallies,
which traverse the sides of steep hills. They rest on calcareous
strata, and sometimes present a front from sixty to
one hundred feet high. When broken into small fragments,
and thrown into boiling water, the stone soon falls into sand;
one bushel of which, by lixiviation and crystallization, frequently
yields ten pounds, and sometimes more than twenty
pounds of nitrate of potassa. The nitre from these rocks contains
little or no nitrate of lime. This account is corroborated
by Dr. Brown,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> to whom our author is indebted for his remarks.</p>

<p>In a memoir in the American Philosophical Transactions
by Dr. Brown, then of Lexington Kentucky, we have a description
of a nitre cave on Crooked Creek, with the process
for extracting the saltpetre. From this memoir, the following
extracts are made: The water which percolates through
the cave in summer, as the walls and floor are dry in winter,
condenses upon the rocks, and the substance thus formed, has
the same properties as the salt obtained by lixiviating the
earth of the floor. As far as the workmen have dug, the
earth is strongly impregnated, every bushel of which, upon
an average, furnishes one pound of nitre. The same earth
will be again impregnated, if thrown into the cave. What
length of time it requires to saturate it, is not known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The workmen have different modes of forming an opinion
with regard to the quantity of nitre, with which the earth
may be impregnated. They generally trust to their taste;
but it is always considered as a proof of the presence of the
nitre, when the impression made one day on the dust by the
hand or foot disappears the day following. Where there is
a great deal of sand mixed with the dust, it is commonly
believed that a small quantity of potash will suffice for the
operation. The method of making saltpetre, usually practised
in Kentucky, is as follows:</p>

<p>The earth is dug, and carried to hoppers of a very simple
construction, which contain about fifty bushels. Cold water
is poured on it for some time, and in a day or two, a solution
of the salts runs into troughs placed beneath the hoppers.
The lixiviation is continued as long as any strength remains
in the earth. The liquor is then put into iron kettles, and
heated to ebullition; it is afterwards thrown upon a hopper
containing wood ashes, through which it is suffered to filtrate.
As the alkaline part of the ashes is discharged before
the nitrate passes through, the first runnings of this hopper are
thrown back, and after some time, the clear solution of nitrate
of potassa runs out, mixed with a white curd, which
settles at the bottom of the trough. This clear liquor is
boiled to the point of crystallization, then settled for a short
time, and put into troughs to crystallize, where it remains
twenty-four hours; the crystals are then taken out, and the
mother water thrown upon the ash hopper, with the next
running of the nitrate of lime. When the quantity of the
nitrate of lime is too great for the portion of ashes employed,
the workmen say their saltpetre is in the <i>grease</i>, and that
they do not obtain a due quantity of nitre. If too much
ashes are used, they say it is in the <i>ley</i>; and when it is left to
settle previous to crystallization, a large quantity of salt will
be deposited in the settling troughs, which they call <i>cubic
salts</i>. These salts are again thrown upon the ash-hoppers,
and are supposed to assist in precipitating the lime from the
nitrate of lime, and in the opinion of the workmen are
changed into pure saltpetre. To make a hundred pounds
of good saltpetre at the great cave, eighteen bushels of oak
ashes are necessary; ten of elm, or two of ashes made by
burning the dry wood in hollow trees. The earth in some
caves does not require half this quantity of wood ashes to
decompose the earthy salts.</p>

<p>When wood ashes cannot be obtained in sufficient quantity,
they make a lixivium of the earth, and boil it down, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
they call <i>thick stuff</i>. This is put in casks, and transported
to a place where ashes can be had. When dissolved and
passed through wood ashes, it is changed, as in the former
process, into saltpetre. Having thus given the Doctor's account,
let us inquire, in the next place, into the theory of the
process.</p>

<p>The theory is very evident. The mixed nitrate, consisting
of variable proportions of nitrate of lime and nitrate of potassa,
is extracted from the saltpetre earth by water, which
dissolves it. Now, as the affinity of nitric acid for potassa
is greater than for lime, and consequently potassa will decompose
nitrate of lime, when the lixivium is passed through
wood ashes, the potassa they contain will unite with the nitric
acid, and the lime be separated, which remains in
the hopper. The liquor holds in solution no other salt
than nitrate of potassa, provided the quantity of alkali in
the wood ashes be sufficient to effect the decomposition;&mdash;if
<i>more</i>, it will pass through in an uncombined state; and if
<i>less</i>, the liquor will contain nitrate of lime. As the alkali
contains more or less carbonic acid, the decomposition is
not a case of single but of double affinity, in which we form,
at the same time, a carbonate of lime.</p>

<p>When the solution is boiled, and set aside in the troughs
to crystallize, the nitre will form in a regular manner. The
mother water, or the fluid which remains after the crystallization,
may contain, from the circumstance before stated, either
potash, or undecomposed nitrate of lime&mdash;hence it is
thrown on the hopper in a subsequent operation.</p>

<p>The nitre, however, as made at the caves, is called <i>rough</i>
or crude nitre. Before it is used for the manufacture of
gunpowder, and other purposes, it is purified or refined.
This operation, which we shall notice more fully hereafter,
is nothing more than the separation of all earthy salts, and
the alkaline muriates and sulphates; in other words, the conversion
of the whole by the separation of foreign substances,
into pure nitrate of potassa.</p>

<p>The mode of treating the <i>rock ore</i>, or sand rocks, which
contain nitre, is the same as before given. It contains more
nitrate of potassa, and therefore requires less potash, and in
some instances, the nitre is perfectly pure. The sand rocks
often yield twenty or thirty pounds per bushel. A mass of
pure nitre, weighing sixteen hundred pounds, has been discovered.
Smaller masses have also been found.</p>

<p>The rocks which contain the greatest quantity of nitre are
extremely difficult to bore, and are tinged brown or yellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Saltpetre makers find it to their interest to work the rock ore
in preference to the calcareous nitrate, as it yields more nitre.</p>

<p>It is a fact well known, that foreign saltpetre contains a variety
of deliquescent salts, or those salts which attract and
absorb moisture and also common salt. The efforts of European
refiners are directed to their separation. The saltpetre
of the Western country, Dr. Brown assures us, does not
contain common salt.</p>

<p>Dr. Brown, in <cite>Silliman's Journal</cite>, i, p. 147, in a letter
to professor Silliman, observes, that there exists a black substance
in the clay under the rocks, of a bituminous appearance
and smell. This black substance, it appears, accompanies the
sand-rock nitre, and is the same as that found in Africa,
which also accompanies nitre in that country. Animal matter
seems to have existed in the nitre caves of Africa, forming,
as Mr. Barrow expresses it, either a <i>roof</i> or covering; no
such matter, however, has ever been found in or adjacent to
the nitre caves of the Western country.</p>

<p>The observations of Mr. Barrow on the subject of the
saltpetre of Africa may be interesting to the reader. He
observes, (<cite>Southern Africa</cite>, p. 291,) that, about twelve miles
to the eastward of the wells, (<i>Hepatic Wells</i>), in a kloof of
the mountain, we found a considerable quantity of native nitre.
It was in a cavern similar to those used by the Bosgesmans
for their winter habitations. The <i>under surface</i> of
the projecting stratum of calcareous stone, and the sides
that supported it, were incrusted with a coating of <i>clear,
white saltpetre</i>, that came off in flakes. The fracture resembled
that of refined sugar; it burnt completely without leaving
any residuum; and if dissolved in water, and thus evaporated,
crystals of pure <i>prismatic nitre</i> were obtained. This
salt, in the same state, is to be met with under the sand-stone
strata of many of the mountains of Africa. There was also
in the same cave, running down the sides of the rock, a
black substance, that was apparently bituminous. The peasants
called it the urine of the das. The dung of this <i>gregarious</i>
animal was lying upon the roof of the cavern to the
amount of many wagon loads.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Cornelius, in describing a cave in the Cherokee
country at Nicojack, the north west angle in the map of
Georgia, (<cite>Silliman's Journal</cite>, vol. i, p. 321,) observes, that
it abounds with nitrate of potassa, a circumstance very common
to the caves of the Western country, and is found covering
the surfaces of fallen rocks, but in more abundance beneath
them. There are two kinds; one is called the "clay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
dirt," the other the "black dirt." The earth, however, contains
calcareous nitre, and for that reason an alkaline lixivium
is employed. In short, the process employed there is
the same as at the other saltpetre caves which we have described.
One bushel of the clay dirt yields from three to
five pounds of nitre, and the black dirt from seven to ten
pounds. It seems also, that the same dirt, if carried back to
the cave, will become impregnated with nitre.</p>

<p>Mr. Cornelius remarks, that these caves have been used
by the natives as burial places; in one of which he counted a
hundred human skulls in the space of twenty feet square; and
infers, that, by the decomposition of animal matter, the acid
of nitric salts arises, and therefore that this may have occasioned
the formation of the nitrates of potassa and lime.</p>

<p>At Corydon, in Indiana, there is a cave, which, according
to Stilson's account, contains both nitrate of lime, and
nitrate of magnesia. It is not worked.</p>

<p>Kain, in his remarks on the Geology and Mineralogy of
East Tennessee, (<cite>Silliman's Journal</cite>, vol. i, p. 65,) observes,
that the numerous caves which have been found in the Cumberland
mountains, and other parts of Tennessee have been
very productive of nitrate of potassa; and in confirmation of
the remarks before made, he adds, in investigating the causes
that have given rise to these salts, that wild animals burrow
in these caves; that, when pursued by the hunter, they
make them the places of their retreat, and probably die
there; that the aborigines have made them a place of burial;
and that the streams of water, which flow through them, in
wet weather, carry with them not only great quantities of
leaves, but many other vegetable productions.</p>

<p>Without offering any theory, by which we may account
for the formation of nitre, in nitre caves, or in situations
which cannot be influenced by the putrefactive process, we
may merely remark, that as nitric acid is composed of oxygen
and azote, there must be some operation unknown to us,
by which the union of these elements takes place. Nascent
azote must unite with the base of oxygen gas; but whence,
in saltpetre caves, proceeds the azote and the oxygen? It
appears that calcareous bodies facilitate the formation of
nitre, as they do in artificial nitre beds. The greater part
of the nitrous earth is lime; and it also appears, that the
same earth, after the extraction of the saltpetre, will again furnish
it. We know that lime is a compound of a base called
calcium united with oxygen; but in what manner it promotes
the union of azote and oxygen, or furnishes either one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
or the other of these bodies, or perhaps both, is altogether
uncertain. Nor can we account for the formation of potash
in the native nitre of the nitre caves. In other situations,
as for instance where nitrous efflorescence appears on the
earth, and in artificial nitre beds, in which animal and vegetable
substances are in the act of decomposition by the putrefactive
fermentation, we may account for the generation
of nitric acid.</p>

<p>It is extremely probable, that the azote of the atmosphere,
and oxygen may combine spontaneously, under particular
circumstances, in various operations of nature. Azote, it is
known, forms with oxygen two gases, a protoxide and deutoxide,
and the same elements in other proportions form
nitric acid. Some condition, unknown to us, must, as an
operating cause, produce this compound. As a condition
for its generation, the presence of calcareous and alkaline
matter, favours the formation of nitric acid. Of this fact,
we have sufficient proof, in the generation of nitre in artificial
nitre beds. But, with respect to natural causes, although
the facts themselves are conclusive, we know little or nothing.</p>

<p>Atmospheric air is a mixture, or compound, according to
some, of two gases, oxygen and azote, with carbonic acid;
but the proportion of the latter rarely exceeds two per cent,
while the quantity of oxygen is about twenty-two. It is a
solvent, as well as a vehicle, and hence may contain water,
gaseous fluids, &amp;c. Miasmata, which is contained often in
the air, are vapours or effluvia, that affect the human system,
and bring on diseases, of which the principal are the intermittent,
remittent, and yellow fevers, dysentery and typhus.
That of the last is generated in the human body itself. The
same, or analogous causes, that produce the formation of
nitric acid, may, under other circumstances, cause the formation
of miasmata; for moist vegetable and other matter, in
some unknown state of decomposition, generates it, and is
known to have caused the yellow and other malignant fevers.
(See an admirable work on the <cite>causes, &amp;c. of the yellow fever
in Philadelphia</cite>, by <span class="smcap lsp">Samuel Jackson</span>, M. D. president of
the board of health, etc. in reply to the observations of Dr.
Hosack.) The contagious <i>virus</i> of the plague, small pox, etc.
as it operates in a more limited distance than marsh, or
other miasmata, is communicated only in certain localities,
and through the intermedium of the atmosphere. As to
the chemical nature of miasmata, there can be no doubt that
azote, under some form of combination, is one of its com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>ponent
parts, and one of the causes of disease. Is not cyanogen,
or carburet of azote, perhaps combined with hydrogen,
in the form of hydrocyanic or prussic acid, the
substance, or <i>principal</i> substance, which forms the miasmata,
that engenders the yellow fever? What compounds may be
formed of hydrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, carbon, and <i>azote</i>,
so as to produce miasmata, that will act specifically on the
system for the production of intermittent, remittent, yellow,
typhus, and other fevers?<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> This inquiry, permit me to add,
is one of no small moment, as it involves in it a question
of great importance relative to the origin of yellow fever.
While we thus digress, in noticing the compounds of azote,
let us briefly remark, as an indisputable conclusion, that the
same causes of malignant disease in the West India islands,
operating under similar circumstances in every respect, may
engender the same disease in our cities.</p>

<p>The atmosphere is subject to changes of various kinds,
and may be considered not only as a solvent, but a repository<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
for different foreign bodies. Electricity, an agent so
essential in the economy of nature, has its ends, its uses; and
while, no doubt, it unites hydrogen with oxygen, in the most
elevated regions of the air, and forms water, it may act
under particular circumstances to produce a union of azote
and oxygen so as to generate nitric acid. Dr. Priestley,
(<cite>Transactions of the American Philosophical Society</cite>,) detected
nitric acid in snow. But of all atmospheric phenomena,
the formation of meteorolites, or meteoric stones, is the most
wonderful. If they be really formed in the atmosphere,
there can be no doubt, that the elementary principles which
compose them must exist in it; and that the phenomenon
denominated meteoric, in such cases, is no other than the
operating cause, by which meteoric stones are generated.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Animal substances furnish azote, as it is one of their constituent
parts; and in the act of its separation, by uniting
with oxygen, principally furnished by the air, it forms nitric
acid; which, attaching itself to the alkali of the vegetable
matter, or the lime usually added to nitre beds, or to other
salifiable bases, forms either nitrate of potassa, nitrate of
lime, or a nitrate of the particular base. The lixiviation of
the nitrous substances, and the use of wood ashes, or potash
itself, will produce saltpetre.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Brongniart has given the following process for purifying
or refining saltpetre: Pulverize the impure nitre, and wash
it three times in cold water, in the proportion of 35 lbs. of
water, to 100 lbs. of the salt, taking care to pour off the water
before another portion is added. These washings separate the
greater part of the muriate of soda, and the deliquescent salts,
such as nitrate of lime. When thus washed, the nitre is
to be dissolved in half its weight boiling water. On cooling,
the salt begins to crystallize, and, by agitating the liquid
during the process, minute crystals are obtained.
These crystals when dried are to be washed in 5 lbs. of cold
water for every 100 lbs. of the salt, and then dried in a temperature
of forty-five degrees.</p>

<p>In India, where nitrate of lime also occurs, but in situations
different from those in the United States, the natives
extract the saltpetre by a process similar to that we have described.
They refine it by solution in water, evaporation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>and crystallization. In France, the potash of commerce is
used; and the nitrates which are decomposed, are those principally
of lime and magnesia.</p>

<p>According to the analysis of M. Pelletier, and the experiments
of professor Vaizo, in 1781, they found the calcareous
earth of the cave at Naples, to contain forty or forty-two to
the hundred, of nitrate of potassa. (See <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales de Chimie</cite>,
tome 23.)</p>

<p>In 1792, M. Pickel announced the discovery of native
saltpetre, in a quarry in the neighbourhood of Wurtzburgh.
M. de la Rochefoucald discovered nitre in the neighbourhood
of chalk in France, in the departments of Seine and
Oise. MM. Lavoisier and Clouet, made a number of researches
with the same view. Since that time, saltpetre, or
nitrous earth has been found in several of the departments
of France; and it appears reasonable to conclude, that in all
situations favourable to the generation of nitre, where the
same causes operate, nitre must occur in more or less abundance.</p>

<p>From the rubbish of old buildings, saltpetre is obtained
in some quantity. Old plaster is said to give five per cent.
The soluble salts it contains, are six in number, viz: nitrate
and muriate of lime, nitrate and muriate of magnesia, and
nitrate of potassa, and muriate of soda. Now it is obvious,
that besides the decomposition of the earthy nitrates, the
earthy muriates also are decomposed by the potash, leaving
in solution, besides muriate of soda, if it is not decomposed,
by the potash, (which has this effect,) muriate, as well as the
nitrate of potassa. To refine the saltpetre prepared in this
manner, consists in separating the muriates. The proportions,
in which these salts are to each other in a hundred
parts, are stated by Thenard, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de Chimie</cite>, Tome ii, p.
485,) to be ten, nitrate of potassa, seventy, nitrates of lime
and magnesia, fifteen, marine salt, and five, muriates of lime
and magnesia.</p>

<p>The mode of extracting saltpetre, and the various processes
which have been adopted for refining it, in France,
and on the continent generally, have but one object,&mdash;that of
lixiviating the substances which afford it, and subsequently,
separating all foreign salts. The best memoir was written
by count Chaptal, occupying forty-seven pages in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales
de Chimie</cite>, tome xx. In this he explains the theory at large.
In the same work, tome xxiii, there is also a paper by Guyton,
and many other memoirs of the same character. In Chaptal's
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chimie Appliqué aux Arts</cite>, tome iv, p. 119, in Thenard's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de Chimie</cite>, tome ii, p. 485, and in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales de Chimie
et de Physique</cite>, tome v, p. 173, the subject is ably treated.</p>

<p>We will now give the process of extracting saltpetre from
the rubbish of old buildings, principally plaster, as adopted
in France. The lixiviation, in the first place, is performed in
the following manner: a certain number of casks or tubs,
thirty-six for instance, is placed in three ranges. These tubs
are pierced laterally near their bottom, by a hole of about
half an inch in diameter, and closed with a cork; they are
placed above a trough connected with a reservoir. There is
put then into each tub a bucket full of the plaster, previously
pounded, which is supported in the casks by cross sticks, a
certain distance from the hole, so as not to obstruct the passage
of the fluid. After this, a bushel of wood ashes is added,
and the tubs are then filled with the plaster. Water is then
put into the tubs of the first row, and after some time, the
stop cocks are turned; water is then put into the tubs of another
row, and the lixiviation is continued until the fluid indicates
the zero of Beaumé's areometer. The saline waters,
which are thus obtained, are divided into three parts, in proportion
to their specific gravity, or quantity of salt they contain.
The lixivium, of five degrees of the areometer, is
known under the name of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eaux de cuite</i>. The waters, which
are marked between three and five degrees, take the name
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eaux de forte</i>; and those below three degrees are called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eaux
faibles</i>. According as the waters are weak, they are made to
run through another range of tubs, in order to saturate them.</p>

<p>When strong and weak solutions are made to pass through
the tubs in the same manner, proceeding from the second
row to the third, and from the third to the first, the <i>earths
plaster</i>, &amp;c. being renewed, the lixiviation is not interrupted.</p>

<p>The lixiviation, it appears, is thus continued; for we obtain,
at the same time, <i>weak waters</i> from the second row, the
<i>strong waters</i> from the third, and the <i>boiling waters</i>, or those
fit to be put into the boilers, from the first.</p>

<p>When a sufficient quantity of the strong solution is obtained,
it is put into the copper, or boiler, and evaporated. During
the evaporation, there is a scum formed, and sundry earthy
substances, in the form of a mud, are deposited. This is usually
caught in a vessel placed in the boiler, which is raised
from time to time, by means of a rope, moved through a pulley,
and fastened to a chain from the handles of the vessel.
The solution is concentrated until it indicates the strength of
twenty-five degrees of Beaumé's areometer. It is then mixed
with the mother water of the preceding boiling, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
concentrated solution of the potash of commerce is added,
until the precipitation ceases. The sulphate of potassa may
be used for the same purpose, at least to decompose the nitrate
of lime; but it must be used in the first instance, and
the operation finished in the common way, by the addition of
potash. The precipitation being finished, that is to say, the
nitrates of lime and magnesia, being transformed into nitrate
of potassa, the hot liquor is then carried in a large tub, called
the <i>reservoir</i>, and placed on the edge of the boiler. As soon
as the insoluble salts, which the solution contains, are deposited
there, which takes place immediately, the liquor is
drawn off clear by cocks, which are adapted to the tubs, and
received into the boiler, previously cleaned. The deposite
obtained in the boiling, is washed with a certain quantity of
the solution, which becomes clear, and is then mixed with
the preceding liquor.</p>

<p>From what has been said, the liquor must contain a great
quantity of nitrate of potassa, a small quantity of the salts of
lime and magnesia, and all the marine salt contained in the
plaster. It is frequently the case, that the liquor contains
muriate of potassa, and a small quantity of sulphate of lime.
It is, therefore, submitted again to evaporation. When it is
at the forty-second degree of concentration, some part of the
marine salt separates, which rises to the surface, and is taken
off, and drained through an osier basket placed over the
boiler. The solution being concentrated to the forty-fifth
degree of the hydrometer, it is put into copper vessels, in
which, by cooling, it crystallizes. The salt is then separated
from the mother water, drained and coarsely bruised, and
afterwards washed in a certain quantity of the <i>first boiling</i>.
It is now in a state to be delivered to the central administration,
under the name of crude saltpetre, or saltpetre of the
first boiling.</p>

<p>The crude saltpetre contains about seventy-five per cent of
nitrate of potassa. The quality may be determined by treating
it with a saturated solution of pure nitrate of potassa,
which cannot dissolve any more of the nitrate, but will dissolve
any foreign salts. The twenty-five parts of the foreign
substances, contained in the crude saltpetre, are composed of
a large quantity of marine salt, and of a small portion of muriate
of potassa. It is necessary to separate them, and other
foreign substances. The operation for this purpose, is called
the <i>refining of saltpetre</i>.</p>

<p>The refining of saltpetre is founded principally upon the
property, which nitre has, of being more soluble in warm wa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>ter,
than the muriate of soda, and muriate of potassa. Thirty
parts of saltpetre, and six parts of water are put into a boiler
and the liquor is heated. By this means, there is precipitated
a large quantity of marine salt mixed with muriate of
potassa. A small quantity of water is added from time to
time, to keep the nitre in solution.</p>

<p>When the foreign salt is not fully deposited, the liquor is
clarified, and more water is added, sufficient to form ten parts,
including that which has already been poured upon it. The
liquor is removed, when it is clear and less heated, and put
into copper vessels, where it is agitated to prevent crystallization,
and to effect the pulverization of the saltpetre.</p>

<p>The saltpetre obtained by this process is not sufficiently
pure. The purification is completed by washing it with water
saturated with nitre, which dissolves the foreign substances.
This washing is completed in a vessel, the bottom of
which has been pierced with holes. The nitre, however,
is left some hours in contact with the water, when the latter
is permitted to run out. When the solution is of the same
degree of concentration as that of the saturated water, the
operation is finished. The nitre is dried for use.</p>

<p>The old process of refining saltpetre is thus described:
Put into a copper, one hundred pounds of nitre, and fourteen
gallons of water; let it boil gently half an hour, removing the
scum as it forms; then stir it, and before it settles put it into
filtering bags, which must be suspended from a rack. Put
under the filters glazed earthen pans, to receive the liquor;
in which place sticks for the crystals to form on. In two or
three days, it will all crystallize.</p>

<p>In some saltpetre works, sulphate of potassa is used with
advantage. This salt is furnished in abundance, by the combustion
of a mixture of nitre and sulphur, in the manufacture
of oil of vitriol. It forms the residue after the combustion.
It is likewise produced in the preparation of nitric
acid, in the decomposition of nitrate of potassa, by sulphuric
acid. It may, therefore, be obtained in quantity, from the
oil of vitriol manufacturers, and the aquafortis distillers. It
is usually called <i>vitriolated tartar</i>.</p>

<p>It is known that sulphuric acid forms, with lime, an almost
insoluble compound, called sulphate of lime, or gypsum;
and hence, when sulphate of potassa is mixed with a solution
of nitrate of lime, nitrate of potassa is formed, which remains
in solution, and sulphate of lime is precipitated. The same
effect takes place with all earthy nitrates. For the application
of sulphate of potassa, in this way, we are indebted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
M. Berard. It might be advantageously employed in decomposing
the calcareous nitrate of the nitre-caves of the
western country.</p>

<p>M. Longchamp has recommended the use of sulphate of
soda, or Glauber's salt, for decomposing the muriate of lime,
which exists occasionally in impure nitre. These two salts
reciprocally decompose each other; sulphate of lime is precipitated,
and muriate of soda remains in solution. The latter
is separated by evaporating the nitrous solution.</p>

<p>M. de Saluces (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoire de l'Académie des Sciences de
Turin, Année, 1805 à 1808</cite>,) has proposed a new process for
purifying nitre. It consists in filtering it through argillaceous
earth, or clay. Although the process is highly spoken
of, yet we can see no particular advantage it possesses.</p>

<p>Chaptal observes, that the process mostly in use is that of
dissolving 2000 pounds of crude saltpetre in a copper boiler,
in 1600 lbs. of water. As the solution is made by the heat,
the scum, which forms, is taken off. Twelve ounces of glue,
dissolved in ten pints of boiling water, and mixed with four
pails full of cold water, are then added. This addition cools
the solution. As to the manipulations of the process, they
have been given. The principal thing to be attended to, is
to separate the marine salt, which is done during the boiling.</p>

<p>To pass this saltpetre through a second operation, in
order the more to purify it, it is again dissolved, in the proportion
of 2000 pounds, in one-fourth of its weight of water.
Heat is applied. The scum is separated; a solution of 8
ounces of glue in one or two pails full of water is then
added. After the solution becomes clear, it is suffered to
cool, and at the expiration of five days, it will crystallize, or
form in a mass, which is then exposed to the air six or eight
weeks to become completely dry.</p>

<p>In treating of the formation of nitre in France, Bottée and
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Rifault'">Riffault</ins> (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de l'Art de Fabriquer la Poudre à Canon</cite>,)
consider it under the following heads:</p>

<p>1. <i>The constituent principles of nitre; its generation, and
the theories respecting it.</i> In this article, the composition of
nitric acid and its union with potassa, and the production of
artificial nitre, are taken into view.</p>

<p>2. <i>Nitrous earths, and substances which yield saltpetre.</i>
This subject comprehends a view of the substances, which
contain saltpetre, as well as those which afford it by nitrification.</p>

<p>3. <i>The preparation of the substances to produce saltpetre.</i>
This article relates to the manipulations required for the
production of nitre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>4. <i>The manner of lixiviating saltpetre earths.</i> The lixiviation
is an important part of the process, however simple it
may appear; as upon its accuracy depends the quantity of
the product.</p>

<p>5. <i>The treatment of the different waters (lixiviums) with
potash, sulphate of potassa, and wood-ashes.</i> This article
points out the use of potash in decomposing the earthy salts,
such as nitrate of lime; of sulphate of potassa, which converts
the nitrate of lime by double decomposition into nitrate
of potassa, the sulphate of lime being precipitated; and of
wood-ashes, which act in the same manner as potash, as
they contain this alkali.</p>

<p>6. <i>The evaporation of saltpetre waters, and the crystallization

This article relates to the different modes of examining saltpetre.</p>

<p>11. <i>On the manufacture of potash and pearlash.</i> This
subject is important, as potash is an <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'indispensible'">indispensable</ins> article in
the preparation of saltpetre, and the formation of the alkali
may be considered as of primary magnitude in establishments,
conducted upon so large a scale as those of France.</p>

<p>It is thus, that a regular system is adopted, by the French
government, for the production of saltpetre; and we may
add also, for the manufacture of gunpowder, which we notice
in that article.</p>

<p>It may be proper to mention some facts, respecting the
formation of nitre-beds, and the means adopted, in this way,
to obtain saltpetre, and to offer, at the same time, some observations
on this mode of obtaining nitre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences</cite>, 1720, contain the
observations of M. Bouldoc, relative to the process of lixiviating
saltpetre earths. Lacourt published a pamphlet some
years after, entitled, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Instruction concernant la Fabrication du
Saltpetre</cite>. Various dissertations appeared on the same subject.
In 1775, the French Academy of Sciences proposed
a prize-question, which produced a more thorough investigation.
The Memoirs of Thouvenal, of the Chevalier de
Lorgna, and of MM. de Chevrand, and Ganivel, were
highly approved, some of which took the prize. Chaptal,
who has done more, perhaps, than any other person in
France, to promote this all-important object, published, in
1794, an excellent dissertation, founded on experiment and
observation. This Memoir was published in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal des
Arts et Manufactures</cite>, t. iii, p. 12.</p>

<p>Kirwan (<cite>Geological Essays</cite>, p. 143,) remarks, that the
saline crust, which is found on the walls of the houses of
Malta, is owing to the walls being built of fine grained limestone.
When wetted with sea-water, it never dries. The
crust is nitrate of potassa, nitrate of lime, and muriate of
soda, and is some tenths of an inch thick. Under this crust,
the stone moulders into dust. When the first falls off, it is
succeeded by a second, and so on, until the whole stone is
destroyed. This particular effect, however, is attributed to
the presence of marine salt.</p>

<p>Mr. Kirwan observes, that, "M. Dolomieu shows, at the
end of his Tract on the Lipari Islands, that the atmosphere
of Malta, in some seasons, when a south wind blows, is remarkably
fouled with mephitic air; and, at other times, when
a north wind blows, remarkably pure; and hence, of all others,
most fit for the generation of nitrous acid." Mr. Kirwan
remarks, "How the alkaline part of the nitre, which is one
of the products resulting from the decomposition of this
stone, is formed, is as yet mysterious: Is it not from the tartarin
lately discovered in clays and many stones?" He adds,
after speaking of animal and vegetable decomposition, "I
should rather suppose, that the alkali is conveyed into these
earths by the putrid air, than newly formed; and the reason
is, that tartarin, (potash,) notwithstanding its fixity, is also
found in soot; and, in the same manner, may be elevated
in putrid exhalations."</p>

<p>Artificial nitre-beds consist of the refuse of animal and
vegetable substances, undergoing putrefaction, mixed with
calcareous earth; the refuse of old buildings, particularly
plaster; earths from the vicinity of inhabited buildings; blood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
urine, &amp;c. They are covered, from the rain, by a shed, open
at the sides. Cramer, an author of credit, informs us, that
he made a little hut, with windows to admit the wind. In
this, he put a mixture of garden mould, the rubbish of lime,
and putrid animal and vegetable substances. He frequently
moistened them with urine, and in a month or two found his
composition very rich in saltpetre, yielding at least one-eighth
part of its weight. The practice of obtaining nitre
from nitre beds, was followed in France and Germany. It
is extracted and refined by the process already given.</p>

<p>When oxygen gas is presented to azote at the moment of
its liberation, nitric acid is formed. As ammonia is the result
of animal putrefaction, or is formed in the process, hydrogen
must unite also with azote. The azote is furnished
by the animal substances. These facts being known, we are
enabled to account for the generation of nitric acid, and, consequently,
of the earthy and other nitrates, in artificial nitre
beds.</p>

<p>In noticing this subject, it is unnecessary to quote the
opinion of Stahl, who believed that there was but one acid
in nature, the sulphuric; and that nitric acid was the sulphuric
acid, combined with phlogiston, which he affirmed was
produced by putrefaction; nor is it necessary to mention the
opinion of Lemery, who believed that nitre exists ready
formed in animals and vegetables by the processes of vegetation
and animalization. The experiments of the French
philosophers have put these opinions at rest.</p>

<p>Thouvenal discovered, that nothing more was necessary
for the production of nitre than a basis of lime, heat, and
open air; so that nitre beds, formed of putrefying animal
and vegetable substances, with the conditions thus stated,
must produce saltpetre; a fact which experience abundantly
justifies.</p>

<p>The process for the formation of nitre, is called <i>nitrification</i>.</p>

<p>Although animal substances, by putrefaction, furnish azote,
and nascent azote unites with facility with the oxygen
of the atmosphere, by which nitric acid is generated&mdash;(hence
the spontaneous decomposition of nitre composts)&mdash;yet Vauquelin
is of opinion, that the presence of calcareous or alkaline
substances is indispensable, and that the production
of carbonate of ammonia from the animal matter, is another
compound, which results from the same decomposition. Ammonia
is produced by the union of azote and hydrogen, and
carbonic acid by that of carbon and oxygen. He considers
then, that the presence of lime, magnesia, potash, &amp;c. <i>determines</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the union of the azote with oxygen, and of course,
the formation of nitric acid; and as this acid unites with
one or other of these substances, according to circumstances,
we have either nitrate of lime, or of magnesia, or nitrate of
potassa. The idea that water is decomposed in the change
which animal and vegetable substances undergo, in the process
of nitrification, is contrary to observation; for the presence
of air in dry situations, is indispensable to the process.</p>

<p>If a compost, made up of animal, vegetable, and calcareous
substances, and put in small beds or heaps, and covered with
a shed open at both sides, be frequently turned to admit new
surfaces to the air, and occasionally moistened with urine, &amp;c.&mdash;nitric
acid will be generated as the putrefaction goes on.
When this process is suffered to proceed until the decomposition
is complete, and the beds then lixiviated, the quantity
of nitre will be considerable. In all cases, we are to observe,
that, as various earthy nitrates are produced, and mostly nitrate
of lime, potash, or wood-ashes which contain this alkali,
are to be used.</p>

<p>It was long since shown by Glauber, that a vault plastered
over with a mixture of lime, wood-ashes, and cows' dung,
soon becomes covered with efflorescent nitre; and that, after
some months, the materials yield, on lixiviation, a considerable
proportion of this salt. M. de Roder, speaking of nitrous
walls, observes, that the efflorescence of nitre on them
is in consequence of the stone, lime, and sand employed in
the building.</p>

<p>What is denominated the <i>saltpetre rot</i>, is an efflorescence
observed on the walls of old buildings, and on the ground.
Dr. C. F. Gren, professor at Halle, in Saxony, (<cite>Principles
of Modern Chemistry</cite>, vol. ii, p. 128), very justly remarks,
that, among the matters capable of corruption, those are the
most convenient in making nitre, which contain the greatest
portion of azote, of which animal substances are the first;
among which he enumerates flesh, blood, skins, excrements
of animals, old woolen stuffs, and urine. He also mentions
marsh plants, green herbs, mud from streets trodden by cattle,
and the ground from marshes or bogs. As a compost he
adds, that the ground from church-yards, where corpses
have successively, and during a long series of years, undergone
corruption, would be the best for artificial nitre beds.
On the subject of nitre beds, the reader may consult the
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Recueil de Mémoires et de Pièces sur la formation et la fabrication
du saltpetre, à Paris</cite>, 1786, 4to. These remarks on
the generation of nitre, although of more ancient date, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
confirmed by James and Herman Boerhaave, (<cite>Chemistry,
&amp;c.</cite>) Hoffman, (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">de Salium Medicorum, et de Præstantissima
Nitri Virtute</cite>), Stahl, (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">de Usu Nitri Medico</cite>), Neuman, (<cite>chemical
works</cite>), and Lewis, (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Materia Medica</cite>)&mdash;all of whom
have written more or less on the formation of saltpetre; to
which we may add the observations of Parr, (<cite>London Medical
Dictionary</cite>, vol. ii, p. 24.)</p>

<p><a name="NITy" id="NITy"></a>
The process for extracting saltpetre from damaged gunpowder
is nothing more than putting it into a boiler, and adding
water sufficient to cover it. On applying heat, the nitre
will be dissolved. If any scum forms, it must be removed.
When the solution is effected, pour it on a sufficient number
of filters, and collect the fluid which passes through. The
residue may be treated with more water, and the whole again
filtered. After boiling the solution, set it aside to crystallize.
The sulphur may be recovered, by subliming the residue
in a temperature not sufficient to inflame it. The charcoal
may be used again for the same purpose.</p>

<p>Saltpetre, when properly refined, does not contain any foreign
salts, and its purity may be known by a variety of experiments,
as follows: make a solution of the salt in distilled
water, and filter it through paper. Put a portion of it
in a wine glass, and add a solution of carbonate of potassa.
To another portion, add a small quantity of muriate, or in
preference, nitrate of barytes. To a third portion, add nitrate
of silver. If the fluid in the first glass remains clear, without
any turbidness, we are to infer the non-existence of earthy
salts; if turbid, that it contains lime, or some other
earth, either in the form of a nitrate or muriate. The addition
of oxalate of potassa to another portion of the solution
will show the presence of lime by forming a precipitate, and
the addition of carbonate of ammonia, and then of phosphate
of soda, will indicate magnesia. If the second glass remains
transparent, it shows that neither sulphuric acid, nor any of
the sulphates are present. If the fluid in the third glass continues
also clear, we infer that none of the muriates exist.
These experiments are sufficient to show the purity of
saltpetre. It would afford perhaps more satisfaction to
institute also the same experiments on other samples of nitre,
by which a comparison may be formed of the relative
purity of each. To make an analysis of the salt, with the
view to determine the proportion of the foreign substances
would be altogether unnecessary for common purposes. A
regularly defined crystal would, in a great measure, point
out its purity. The double refined saltpetre is chemically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
pure. Artificers determine the purity of nitre by its flame;
if white, they call it pure, if yellow, impure.</p>

<p>The same reagents may be used in the examination of gunpowder,
as we shall notice hereafter. If a portion of powder be
mixed with distilled water, the water will dissolve only the
saline substances, leaving the charcoal and sulphur. When
the whole is thrown on a filter, the fluid, which passes
through, will contain the saltpetre, and foreign salts, if any
are present. The same experiments may then be performed
with the solution, and the quality of the nitre, of which the
gunpowder was made, be determined. Some gunpowder absorbs
a large portion of water, which is owing to the presence
of deliquescent salts. These salts may be detected by proceeding
in the way we have pointed out. The art of refining
saltpetre is so well known of late in the United States, especially
by the Messrs. Dupont of Brandywine, Delaware, that
our gunpowder is of a very superior quality. I have examined
various specimens of this saltpetre, and gunpowder made with
it, and could not detect any of the sulphates or muriates, either
alkaline or earthy. For the manufacture of gunpowder,
and fire-works generally, the nitre, it may be observed, cannot
be too pure.</p>

<p>In pyrotechny, it is necessary to have the nitre in powder.
Pulverizing it in a mortar is a tedious method, if a large
quantity is required for use. There is an advantage, likewise,
in the mode we will describe; because the saltpetre, besides
being extremely fine, is made perfectly dry. Put into a
copper kettle, whose bottom must be spherical, fourteen pounds
of refined saltpetre, with two quarts or five pints of water.
Put the kettle on a slow fire, and if any impurities rise and
form a scum, remove them; keep constantly stirring with two
large spatulas, till the water evaporates, and the nitre is reduced
to a powder. This will be perfectly white, and almost
impalpable. If it should boil too fast, remove the kettle, and
set it on wet sand, which will also prevent the nitre from adhering
to the pot. It should be kept in a dry place. This
process of powdering saltpetre is performed on a large scale
for the manufacture of gunpowder.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="NITx" id="NITx"></a><i>Sec. II. Of Nitrate of Soda.</i></p>

<p>This salt has been recommended in lieu of nitre, for preparing
certain fire-works; but we confess, we can see no particular
advantage in using it. It has the property of attracting
humidity from the air, and on that account is rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
unfit for the manufacture of gunpowder. This salt is composed
of nitric acid and soda. It was formerly called <i>cubic
nitre</i>. It may be formed, very readily, by saturating nitric
acid with soda, and evaporating the solution. It crystallizes
in rhomboidal prisms. It may be formed more economically,
by mixing together the solutions of nitrate of lime and sulphate
of soda, filtering the mixture, and evaporating the filtered
liquor. It will be sufficient to observe, that it deliquesces,
or absorbs moisture, and in the fire, that its phenomena
are the same as those of nitre. It does not melt so readily.</p>

<p>Used in the same proportion as nitre, it will form a gunpowder,
which soon, however, spoils by exposure. It will,
like nitre, communicate a yellow colour to the flame of alcohol.
Experiments were made with this salt, with the view to
the fabrication of gunpowder, by MM. Bottée and Riffault.
Their conclusions, as we have stated, may be seen in their
work on <i>gunpowder</i>. Professor Proust says, that five parts of
nitrate of soda, with one of charcoal, and one of sulphur, will
burn three times as long as common powder, so as to form
an economical composition for fire-works.</p>

<p>The <i>cubic nitre</i>, and the <i>nitrum flammans</i> were known,
and so called, by the older chemists. The former we have
seen, is the nitrate of soda, and the latter, is a combination of
nitric acid and ammonia. Nitrate of soda, consists of 6.75
acid + 3.95 soda.</p>

<p>Nitrate of ammonia possesses the property of exploding;
and, when exposed to a temperature of about six hundred degrees,
is decomposed, furnishing the nitrous oxide, called also
the protoxide of azote, and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'exhilirating'">exhilarating</ins> gas, besides water.
Nitrate of ammonia is composed of 6.75 acid + 2.13
ammonia + 1.125 water.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i><a name="CLPx" id="CLPx"></a>Sec. III. Of Chlorate of Potassa.</i></p>

<p>This salt, formerly called hyperoxymuriate of potassa, is
used for sundry preparations, and especially for experimental
fire-works. It is prepared by dissolving one part of carbonate
of potassa in six parts of water, and saturating it with
chlorine, formerly called oxymuriatic acid gas. This operation
is usually performed in a Woulfe's apparatus. The gas,
as it proceeds from the retort or gas bottle, is brought in contact
with, and passes through, the fluid. It is formed by
pouring liquid muriatic acid on the black oxide of manganese,
or by pouring sulphuric acid on a mixture of muriate
of soda, and the black oxide. When the saturation is nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
complete, crystals fall down. These being dissolved in boiling
water, and the solution allowed to stand, pure chlorate of
potassa will be formed.</p>

<p>This salt is composed of 9.5, chloric acid, and 6 potassa;
and chloric acid is formed of 28.87, chlorine, and 32.28,
oxygen. It is to the oxygen in the salt, that its particular
properties in fire-works are to be ascribed.</p>

<p>This salt is decomposed by all combustible bodies, and detonations
generally accompany the decomposition. Hence it
is used in a variety of experiments, some of which we will
give.</p>

<p>Three parts of the salt and one of sulphur detonate when
rubbed in a mortar. The same mixture, struck with a hammer
on an anvil, produces a loud explosion. Phosphorus detonates
with this salt either by trituration or percussion. The
quantity of each should not exceed a grain. Treated in the
same manner with almost all the metals, the same effect takes
place. Cinnabar, antimony, pyrites, &amp;c. produce the same effect.
Nitric acid, poured on a mixture of this salt with
phosphorus, produces flashes of fire. A mixture of the chlorate
and white sugar, when touched with sulphuric acid, immediately
inflames. Hence it is used in the preparation of
pocket lights; the mixture being put on a common sulphur
match, and immersed in sulphuric acid. The same preparation
of sugar and chlorate of potassa, put over a tube used
for firing artillery, will set fire to the priming fuse, by dropping
on it sulphuric acid. Owing to this effect, M. Gassicourt
(<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives des Découvertes</cite>), recommended a similar mixture
for discharging cannon by means of this acid. As it contains a
large quantity of oxygen, that gas may be obtained from it
by distillation. Light decomposes it. It should, therefore, be
excluded from the light.</p>

<p><a name="THEx" id="THEx"></a><a name="GUNy" id="GUNy"></a>
As this salt, when mixed with inflammable substances, detonates
when struck with a hammer, it has been used for the
purpose of inflaming gunpowder without the use of the flint
and steel. There are several formulæ given for the purpose.
We remarked, when treating of the general theory of fire-works,
that the Rev. Alexander Forsyth discovered a new
kind of gunpowder, which inflames merely by percussion;
that the gun-lock, which he contrived, was calculated for firing
cannon, as well as musquetry; that it was so contrived as
to hold forty primings of such powder; and that the act of
raising the cock primes the piece. In his composition, each
charge of priming contains no more than one-eighth of a
grain of chlorate of potassa. Since that period, it appears,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
that the lock, as well as the powder, has been improved, although
neither of them is in general use. Thenard, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité
de Chimie</cite>, tome ii, p. 559, troisième édition), has given a
formula for preparing a priming powder of this salt, adapted
to the new lock, which is made by mixing it with 0.55
of nitrate of potassa, 0.33 of sulphur, 0.17 of the raspings
of peach-wood passed through a fine sieve, and 0.17 of
lycopodium, or puffball. (See <a href="#INFx"><i>Inflammable Powder</i>.</a>)</p>

<p>This salt also produces powerful effects with charcoal and
sulphur. Three parts of it, with half a part of sulphur, and
half a part of charcoal powder, produce most violent explosions.
Two persons, in 1788, lost their lives by it. If this
mixture be thrown into concentrated sulphuric acid, a brilliant
flame is produced. Such mixtures, we are informed, will
explode spontaneously. It should not, for that reason, be kept
prepared. Chlorate of potassa has been used in the place of
nitre, for the manufacture of gunpowder, in consequence of
its decomposition by charcoal. From its explosive effects,
M. Berthollet was induced to propose it as a substitute for
nitre. The proportions used by Chaptal, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chimie Appliqué
aux Arts</cite>, tome iv, p. 198), are six parts of chlorate of potassa,
one of sulphur, and one of charcoal. They are to be mixed
in a marble mortar with a wooden pestle. The first experiment
was made at Essone, in France, in 1788. No
sooner, however, had the workmen begun to triturate the
mixture, than it exploded with violence, and killed two persons.</p>

<p>The force of this gunpowder is greater than that of the
common sort; but the danger of preparing it, and even of
using it, is so great, that these circumstances will always prevent
its introduction. A salt, containing so much oxygen,
and so loosely combined, that even the slightest friction, in
contact with inflammable bodies, will separate it, must, of
necessity, prevent its use in that way.</p>

<p>The experiments, which were made at the arsenal at Paris,
on the 27th of April, 1793, comparing the effects of muriated
powder, and the superfine common powder, have given us
the following results:</p>

<p>1st. By the eprouvette of Darcy, consisting of a cannon,
which, being suspended to the extremity of a bar of iron,
described by its recoil an arc, of which the degrees can be
measured.</p>

</table>

<p class="p1">From these results, it appears, that, by the eprouvette of
Darcy, the muriated powder, or that prepared with chlorate
of potassa, gave a superiority of force of about one-fourth.</p>

<p>2nd. By the eprouvette of Regnier, which is repelled by
the explosion, to a distance greater or less, measured by the
degrees of the arc which it describes:</p>

<tr><td class="tdl">Common powder, superfine,</td><td class="tdl">23</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Idem,</td><td class="tdl">22½</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="p1">From which it results, that by the eprouvette of Regnier,
the force of the powder of the oxymuriate is double that of
the nitrate, or common powder.</p>

<p>M. Ruggieri is of opinion, that chlorate, or hyperoxymuriate
of potassa may be employed with advantage in the
composition of rockets, but we have not heard that it has
been used. It is more powerful in its effects, and probably
for this reason he recommended it. This salt, mixed with
other substances, will produce the <i>green fire</i> of the palm-tree,
in imitation of the Russian fire.</p>

<p>Chloric acid may be obtained in a separate state, by boiling
the compound solution formed by passing chlorine gas
through a solution of barytic earth, with phosphate of silver,
which separates the muriatic acid. By evaporation, the
chlorate of barytes will crystallize in fine rhomboidal prisms.
When these crystals are dissolved in water, and diluted sulphuric
acid added by degrees, an acid liquid will be obtained,
which, if the sulphuric acid be added cautiously, will be found
entirely free from the latter acid and barytes, and not affected
by nitrate of silver. This is the chloric acid dissolved in
water. Chloric acid unites with sundry bases. Combined
with ammonia, it forms a fulminating salt, formerly described
by M. Chenevix. This salt is formed, by mixing together
carbonate of ammonia, and chlorate of lime. The carbonate
of lime is then separated by the filter, and the clear liquid,
holding the chlorate of ammonia in solution, is evaporated.
Chlorate of ammonia is very soluble in water and alcohol,
and decomposed by a moderate heat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Chlorates, as the chlorate of potassa, are formed more
readily in the manner already stated: <i>viz.</i> by saturating the
base with chlorine, but in this case two salts are produced,
the chlorate and hydrochlorate. Chloric acid has also been
obtained in a separate state, from chlorate of potassa, by a
process recommended by Mr. Wheeler.</p>

<p>Perchloric acid, composed of seven primes of oxygen
and one of chlorine, is obtained from chlorate of potassa,
treated in a particular manner. Three parts of sulphuric acid
and one of chlorate of potassa, when heated, will give a saline
mass, consisting of bisulphate of potassa, and perchlorate
of potassa. Deutoxide of chlorine will be evolved.
The perchlorate detonates feebly when triturated with sulphur.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. IV. Sulphur.</i></p>

<p>Sulphur, or brimstone, is a principal ingredient in almost
all the compositions of fire-works. It should, therefore, be
pure. The flowers may be considered the purest kind of sulphur.</p>

<p>Sulphur is found native, either alone, or accompanying
certain minerals, such as gypsum, rock-salt, marl, and clay, as
in Switzerland, Poland, and Sicily. In the neighbourhood of
salt-springs, it is also found; and frequently in water, in
combination with hydrogen, forming the natural hepatic waters.
It is also found on the surface of the earth, as in Siberia.
Volcanic sulphur, or that which occurs in the fissures
and cavities of lava, near the craters of volcanoes, is
very common.</p>

<p>Solfatere, Sicily, the Roman states, Guadaloupe, and Quito,
in the Cordilleras, are most celebrated for native sulphur.
It has been found in the United States, but in no quantity.
We have a number of mineral springs, which deposite sulphur.
The Clifton Springs of Ontario are of this kind. It occurs
abundantly, in combination with hydrogen, as sulphuretted
hydrogen gas, in various parts of the United States.</p>

<p>Native sulphur is abundant in the island of Java. It is
obtained from the now almost extinct volcano, about sixty
miles from the town of Batavia. At the bottom of the crater,
there is said to lie many hundred tons of native sulphur.
Silliman (<cite>Journal</cite>, vol. i, p. 58) observes, that it is in the
crater of this volcano, that the celebrated lake of sulphuric
acid exists, "and from which it flows down the mountain,
and through the country below, a river of the same acid."</p>

<p>Sulphur, however, is usually obtained from pyrites or me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>tallic
sulphurets, by fusion and sublimation. It is usually
denominated by the name of the place whence it comes.
Hence we have the Italian and Sicilian sulphur; the crude,
roche, or stone brimstone of Marseilles, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The quantity of sulphur, which may be obtained from the
galena, or sulphuret of lead, by sublimation, is considerable.
Twenty-five per cent is the loss sustained in the reduction of
the lead ore, which occurs so abundantly in the neighbourhood
of St. Louis. When general, the then lieut. Pike,
(<cite>Expeditions, &amp;c. Appendix</cite>) interrogated Mr. Dubuque in
1805, respecting the quantity of lead obtained from those
mines, a detailed account of which is given by Schoolcraft,
he replied that the mineral would yield seventy-five per cent.
of lead, and hence the twenty-five per cent. loss must be the
sulphur, together with any foreign matter it may contain.</p>

<p>The experiments of M. Vauquelin, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales de Chimie</cite>,
1811) to determine the quantity of sulphur contained in some
metallic sulphurets, show, at once, the proportion which may
be obtained from those combinations. Thus he found, that
sulphuret of copper contains 21.31 per cent of sulphur; sulphuret
of tin, 14.1; sulphuret of lead, 13.77; sulphuret of
silver, 12.73; sulphuret of iron, 22; sulphuret of antimony,
25; sulphuret of bismuth, 31.75; sulphuret of manganese,
74.5; and sulphuret of arsenic, 43.</p>

<p>Of native or prismatic sulphur, there are two species,
the common and volcanic. The former is of two kinds, the
compact and earthy.</p>

<p>Sulphur, says Hanway, (<cite>Travels, &amp;c.</cite>) is dug at Baku on
the western side of the Caspian sea. It is found in the
neighbourhood of the celebrated naphtha springs, some of
which form a mouth of 8 or 10 feet diameter.</p>

<p>Von Humboldt (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales de Museum National</cite>) communicated
to the French national institute, that he discovered,
in the province of Quito, a bed composed of sulphur and
quartz, in a mountain of mica slate, and also sulphur in primitive
porphyry. Kirwan (<cite>Geological Essays</cite>, p. 143) observes,
that sulphur promotes decomposition, by absorbing oxygen,
while it is thus converted into vitriolic acid; but moisture is
also requisite. He attributes, in the same manner, the decomposition
of stones that contain pyrites.</p>

<p>As the sulphur, which occurs in commerce, is chiefly obtained
from its native combinations, it may be proper to
make some brief remarks on this head. Sulphur in the state
of combination is abundantly met with, and in all countries.
It is found in the state of sulphuric acid, in various salts, as
gypsum, epsom salt, native alum, &amp;c.; and united with me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>tals,
forming natural sulphurets, as in sulphuret of iron, or
iron pyrites, sulphuret of copper, or copper pyrites, sulphuret
of lead, or potter's lead ore, called also galena, sulphuret
of antimony, or crude antimony, sulphuret of zinc, or blende,
sulphuret of mercury, or cinnabar, sulphuret of arsenic, or
orpiment, &amp;c. In fact, it appears to be a general mineralizer.
It is found also in some plants, and in animal substances.</p>

<p>Without detailing minutely the processes employed for
extracting sulphur from its combinations, which may be seen
in Thenard, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de Chimie</cite>, tome i, p. 184) it will be sufficient
to observe, that, in general, pyrites, both of iron and
copper, are arranged in alternate layers in the form of a pyramid,
and the <i>roasting</i> is continued for several months. Part
of the sulphur is consumed, and part is sublimed, and is
condensed and collected in hollows, in the upper part of the
pyramid, whence it is removed several times a day. It is
also obtained from pyrites, by a kind of distillation. They
are reduced to coarse powder, and put into hollow iron
cylinders, or retorts, where the sulphur is disengaged and
melted, and thence runs into vessels of water. This process
is employed in Saxony, where nine hundred pounds of pyrites
will yield one hundred to one hundred and fifty pounds
of sulphur, which is afterwards purified.</p>

<p>When melted and cast into wooden moulds, it forms the roll
brimstone; and, by sublimation, conducted in large chambers,
as we shall afterwards mention, it is converted into the flowers
of sulphur. The residue of the sublimation is <i>sulphur
vivum</i>, which is also used in fire-works. The roll brimstone
is frequently adulterated.</p>

<p>In the island of Anglesea, it is obtained by the sublimation
of the yellow copper ore. The operation is conducted in kilns,
and the sulphur is conveyed by means of long horizontal
flues, and collected in large chambers. As the United States
furnish an abundance of martial pyrites, and also galena,
sulphur might be manufactured in this country, and advantageously,
especially from galena, which is very abundant in
the neighbourhood of St. Louis. In the roasting of the ore,
all the sulphur is now lost, tons of which might be collected.</p>

<p>For the purpose of gunpowder, the purer the sulphur, the
better will be the powder; hence attention is always paid to
this circumstance. M. Michel, one of the principal refiners
of sulphur at Marseilles, has improved the process for purifying
sulphur for the purpose of gunpowder. M. Libaw,
connected likewise with the French national powder establishment,
has furnished a very useful and important memoir on
the same subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Two methods are proposed for the refining of sulphur,
which we will briefly state, namely, fusion, and sublimation.
The first is conducted in iron pots fixed in a furnace; and
the sulphur, before it is thrown in, is beaten into small pieces
with a mallet. This facilitates the fusion, and renders it
more uniform. Small portions at a time are thrown into the
boiler, and stirred frequently with a wooden spatula. This
manipulation ought to be continued till the boiler is filled.
The heat must be regulated so as not to inflame, or sublime
the sulphur.</p>

<p>The sulphur of commerce is commonly of three different
colours, viz: citron-yellow, deep yellow, and brownish-yellow.
These colours depend on the different degrees of heat
to which the sulphur was exposed, in its extraction. The
operation of refining consists in conducting the fire in such
a manner, as that the colour of the sulphur will assume a
brilliant yellow, bordering on a green. We must, therefore,
to produce this effect, operate on the sulphur according to
its colour. For the green sulphur, as little heat has been
used for its extraction, the fire may be left under the boiler
until there is no more left to melt than the top. The sulphur
of the yellow colour may be kept longer on the fire,
which may be removed when the mass is melted three-fourths.
The sulphur of a brown colour, being already much burnt,
may be removed when the mass is melted one-half. If it is
required to operate on all the varieties at the same time, in
order to produce sulphur of a uniform colour, in that case
we must fill the boiler one-half with the green sulphur, one-fourth
with the yellow, and the remainder with the brown,
and removing the fire when the yellow is almost wholly
melted. The boiler is then covered with a lid. The fusion
is completed by the heat of the mass. The light bodies then
raise themselves to the surface, forming a black scum, which
is removed, and the heavy bodies fall to the bottom. The
boiler remains for four or five hours, uncovering it from time
to time to take off the scum. The fluid part is removed,
and is suffered to congeal, taking care not to disturb the deposite.</p>

<p>The second process of refining is by sublimation. This
operation consists in subliming it in a close apparatus, which
in sulphur refineries are boilers placed in brick work, and
furnished with heads. These heads communicate by a pipe
with a vaulted chamber, placed at some distance from the
furnace. The chamber serves to collect the sulphur. There
is usually a stone slab fixed between the chamber and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
head. The chamber is furnished with one or two iron-plate
valves. There is an opening in the head of each boiler, in
order to renew the sulphur: it is closed very tight by a plate
of iron. There is an opening also in the chamber, to admit
a person, which is closed likewise by an iron plate. The
heads are luted before the process is commenced.</p>

<p>By this process the sulphur is refined; for the pure part
is sublimed, and the foreign substances remain in the pots.
The product thus obtained is the ordinary flowers of sulphur.
If the heat be moderate, the sublimation is more perfect. It
is necessary at the same time that the temperature of the
chamber should be low, otherwise the sulphur will melt,
which frequently takes place. Coarse particles are separated
from the flour, should they occur, by a sieve.</p>

<p>During the first part of the process, there is formed some
sulphurous acid gas, which is not produced after the vapour
of sulphur forms the atmosphere in the head. This is known
to exist, by the acid taste of the sulphur, and its black
colour.</p>

<p>Detonation very frequently takes place, and sulphurous
acid gas is produced. In the sublimation of brimstone,
about ten to eleven per cent. is the usual total loss, of which
six or seven per cent. is residue. The acid may be separated
from the sulphur by washing it in water, and afterwards
drying it. It is then called the washed flowers of sulphur.
(See <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de l'Art de Fabriquer la Poudre à Canon</cite>, p.
153.) by MM. Bottée and Riffault, for a minute description
of this process.</p>

<p>Sulphur undergoes no change by exposure to the air. It
is insoluble in water. It breaks in the hand with a crackling
noise. At 170 degrees it begins to evaporate, and when
collected it is called sublimed, or flowers of sulphur. It
melts at 218 degrees. When melted and poured into water,
it forms the <i>sulphurs</i> for taking the impression of coin, &amp;c.
If melted, and cooled slowly, it will crystallize in the form
of needles. It is soluble in different degrees in alcohol,
ether, and oils. When sulphur is burnt very slowly in the
open air, it unites with oxygen and forms sulphurous acid.
This acid is used in bleaching. When mixed with nitre,
and burnt in leaden chambers, it forms sulphuric acid, or
oil of vitriol, by which process it combines with a larger
quantity of oxygen. There is another compound called hyposulphurous
acid, all the salts of which are inflammable
and burn with a blue flame. Sulphur unites with the alkalies,
earths, and metals. If the alkaline sulphurets be dissolved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
in water, and an acid added, the sulphur will precipitate of
a white colour, known by the name of milk of sulphur. It is
considered by some a hydrate of sulphur. The same preparation
is made by subliming sulphur in a vessel containing
the vapour of water. Sulphur unites with chlorine and
iodine, forming chlorides, and iodides. With hydrogen, it
forms the sulphuretted hydrogen, or hepatic gas, called also
the hydrothionic and hydrosulphuric acid; with carbon, the
sulphuret of carbon; and with nitre and charcoal, in the state
of mixture, it constitutes gunpowder.</p>

<p>The motionless <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignes fatui</i> of Italy, which are seen nightly
on the same spot, are attributed to the slow combustion of
sulphur, emitted through clefts and apertures in the soil of
that volcanic country; but the <i>Will-with-the-Wisp</i>, which
moves in undulations, near the surface of the ground, in
swampy situations, and where the putrefactive process is
going on, originates in all probability from decaying vegetable
and other matters, and the extrication of phosphorus. It
is known that the acid of phosphorus is found in plants, and
especially those that grow in marshy places, in turf, and
several species of the white woods.</p>

<p><i>Mealing of Brimstone.</i> What is termed the mealing of
sulphur by fire-workers, is no other than reducing it, if it be
the roll, to powder. Large mortars and pestles made of
ebony, and other hard wood, and horizontal mills with brass
wheels are used. The <i>mealing table</i> is used by artificers.
It is generally made of elm, with a rim around its edge four
or five inches high. One end is narrow, and furnished with
a slider that runs in a groove, and forms part of the rim.
After using as much of the powdered brimstone as is required,
copper shovels being employed, the rest may be
swept out at the slider. This table is also used for the mealing
of gunpowder and saltpetre. The muller is generally
made of ebony. After reducing it to powder, it is then passed
through a lawn sieve, furnished with a cover.</p>

<p>As brimstone is frequently adulterated with different substances,
it may be of importance to discover the fraud. We
may remark, that, if it is pure, it will be taken up entirely
by chlorine gas, or by using a solution of caustic potassa.
The latter, however, cannot be depended on in all cases. But
the best mode, is that of melting some of it in a ladle; if any
residue remains, after the fumes have ceased, the presence
of foreign substances may be inferred, for pure sulphur will
sublime without leaving any residue. It is not unfrequently
adulterated with common flour. There is another mode of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
determining the quality of sulphur, It should, if pure, be
completely soluble in boiling oil of turpentine. If any residue
remain, we may infer the presence of foreign substances,
either vegetable, earthy, or metallic.</p>

<p>It is obvious, that if the brimstone is impure, the effect of
it in fire-works will be imperfect. Flowers of sulphur,
however, may be almost always depended on. In all artificial
fire, in which sulphur forms a part, the <i>flame</i> is more
clear, as the sulphur is pure.</p>

<p>Several modes are recommended for the separation of
sulphur from charcoal, in gunpowder, which may be seen by
referring to the analysis, or chemical examination of gunpowder.</p>

<p>Sulphur constitutes one of the ingredients, generally speaking,
of incendiary compositions, used for military purposes,
and, in such cases, is usually mixed with pitch, tar, saltpetre,
and sometimes gunpowder. It is said to be one of the substances,
which entered into the composition of the ancient and
celebrated Greek fire; but the principal character of which,
that of burning in water, was owing to the presence of camphor.
This substance, associated with sulphur, pitch, and nitre,
forms one of the most effective incendiaries of all military
fire-works. For such purposes, it is hardly necessary to
add, that the common roll brimstone is sufficiently pure.</p>

<p>As to the mode of preparing these works, the custom is
to melt the resinous substances first, then to add the sulphur,
and finally the saltpetre; and after the whole are melted and
thoroughly mixed, to remove the pot from the fire, and add
gradually the gunpowder. If a carcass is to be made, tow
or hemp, or untwisted rope, is immersed in the composition
while hot, and taken out and formed into a ball of the size
required. Rope, treated in the same manner, with the same
composition, will make a more active tourteaux than the
common kind. (See <i><a href="#CARx">Carcass</a> and <a href="#TOUx">Tourteaux</a></i>.)</p>

<p>All oils, whether expressed or essential, can dissolve sulphur.
To make this solution, the oil must be poured on the
sulphur, and sufficient heat applied to melt the substance.
While the oil dissolves the sulphur, it acquires a reddish or
brown colour, an acrid, disagreeable taste, and a strong fetid
smell, somewhat hepatic, resembling that of oil with sulphuric
acid.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="PHOx" id="PHOx"></a><i>Sec. V. Of Phosphorus.</i></p>

<p>We mention this substance, because it is used in some experiments,
although not in extensive fire-works. It is a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
inflammable substance, inflaming either by friction, or an increase
of temperature. It produces a most brilliant fire, and
when mixed with some substances, exhibits very pleasing phenomena.
It usually comes to us in sticks, which must be constantly
kept in water to prevent its inflammation. Phosphoric
matches, phosphoric fire-bottles, &amp;c. are made of it. These
are made in various ways. Phosphorus and sulphur melted
together in a small phial, forms the fire-bottle, or some add
a portion of lime. A sulphur-match dipped in this mixture
and gently rubbed, immediately inflames. They do not last
any time, in consequence of the acidification of the phosphorus.
Phosphoric tapers are usually made with a glass tube,
on the breaking of which, it inflames. When rubbed upon a
wall in a dark room, it appears very luminous. Dissolved in
ether, and poured upon boiling water in the dark, the vapour
as it ascends appears remarkably luminous, and has a pleasing
effect. Dissolved in oil, as olive-oil, it forms the phosphorized
oil, which may be rubbed on the face and hands
without injury. This oil has the same appearance in the
dark. The time of night may be known by the light it produces.
When mixed with nitrate of silver, sulphuret of antimony,
sulphur, chlorate of potassa, &amp;c. and struck with a
hammer, it produces an explosion more or less loud. A variety
of explosive compounds may be made with it, but they
must be used with great care.</p>

<p>When combined with hydrogen, it inflames spontaneously
when brought in contact with atmospheric air. It inflames
also in chlorine gas. It is supposed to be the cause of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignes fatui</i>, or <i>Will-with-the-Wisp</i>. The formation of phosphoretted
hydrogen gas may be shown in a variety of ways,
as the following: throw some pieces of phosphuret of lime into
water, and bubbles of gas will rise, which will take fire on
coming to the air; or, put into a flask some phosphorus, iron
or zinc filings, water, and sulphuric acid, and the gas will
be generated; or, introduce into a small retort, a solution of
potassa, and a piece or two of phosphorus, and apply heat,
immersing the beak of the retort in a basin of water, the gas
will pass over, and inflame as it comes to the surface of the
water. In all these experiments, the water is decomposed;
its oxygen goes to a part of the phosphorus in the first experiment,
and the hydrogen of the water then unites with
another portion of phosphorus, which is then evolved; in the
second experiment, the oxygen oxidizes the metal, and the
hydrogen dissolves a part of the phosphorus; and in the third
experiment, the phosphorus unites with the potassa, forming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
a phosphuret, which decomposes the water, the hydrogen of
which passes off in combination with some of the phosphorus,
forming the phosphuretted hydrogen gas.</p>

<p>The cause of the spontaneous combustion is, that the oxygen
of the atmosphere unites with the hydrogen and the
phosphorus, and forms water and phosphoric acid; the latter
producing a beautiful corona as it rises in the air. The
heat and light given out proceeds as well from the oxygen
gas, as from the phosphuretted hydrogen gas. When saturated
with oxygen, it is no longer inflammable.</p>

<p>There are some other experiments which can be made with
this singular substance.</p>

<p>It was formerly obtained from urine, as that fluid contains
some phosphoric salts. It is now prepared from bones. These
are burnt to an ash, and diluted sulphuric acid is poured on
it; the phosphoric acid it contains is then disengaged, and remains
in the fluid. The sulphate of lime is then separated,
the fluid boiled to dryness, and the dry mass is mixed with
charcoal, and distilled in the open fire.</p>

<p>The phosphoric pencil, for writing on a wall, paper, &amp;c.
to be luminous in the dark, is nothing more than a bit of
phosphorus put into a quill. It must be kept in water, and
when used, frequently dipped in water, to prevent its taking
fire.</p>

<p>The <i>phosphoric</i> stone of M. Bucholz, described in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives
des Découvertes</cite>, ii, p. 109, is a phosphuret of magnesia,
prepared by melting thirty grains of phosphorus in a
small flask, and adding twenty or thirty grains of calcined
magnesia. Although this process is given by Bucholz, yet,
as it is difficult to prevent the inflammation of the phosphorus,
the best mode would be to bring the vapour of phosphorus
in contact with magnesia, in the same manner as in preparing
phosphuret of lime.</p>

<p>The pyrophorus of Wurzer is nothing than a phosphuret
of lime. It is prepared by taking two parts of pulverized
quicklime, and one part of phosphorus; introducing them into
a bottle, and covering it with three parts of quicklime,
leaving one-third of the bottle empty; then putting the bottle
into a crucible surrounded with sand, previously stopping
the mouth with clay, and applying heat. Remove the phial
when the phosphorus appears to sublime of a red colour.
When the bottle is opened it becomes luminous, and brought
out it inflames.</p>

<p>Phosphorus in the state of acidification, and united with
lime, is found in abundance. Whole mountains in the pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>vince
of Estremadura in Spain, are said to be composed of
this combination. According to Mr. Bowles, this stone is
whitish and tasteless, and affords a blue flame without smell
when thrown upon burning coals. Mr. Proust observes, that
it is a dense stone, not hard enough to strike fire with steel,
and is found in strata, which always lie horizontally upon
quartz, and which are intersected with veins of quartz. He
adds, that it does not decrepitate on burning coals, but burns
with a beautiful green light. This stone is the common phosphorite.
It contains, according to Klaproth, 32.25 per cent.
of phosphoric acid.</p>

<p>Several substances are known under the name of phosphorus,
although they do not contain it, such as Baldwin's phosphorus,
or ignited muriate of lime, Canton's phosphorus, or
oyster-shells calcined with lime, and Bologna phosphorus, or
calcined sulphate of barytes.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VI. Of Charcoal.</i></p>

<p>Charcoal performs an important part in all the various
kinds of fire-works. The facility with which it decomposes
nitric acid, when it is combined with salifiable bases, as with
potassa in saltpetre, and its action in all cases wherein nitre
is concerned, are sufficient examples of its effect.</p>

<p>Pure carbon is the diamond. It affords by combustion in
oxygen gas, the same gas as common charcoal, when charcoal
is burnt in oxygen, or in atmospheric air. This gas is
carbonic acid, or fixed air. Charcoal has been considered a
long time an oxide of carbon, and according to some, as Berthollet,
a compound of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.</p>

<p>Charcoal is insoluble in water. It is not affected by the
most violent heat, if confined in close vessels. It is an excellent
conductor of electricity, but a bad conductor of heat. It
is very indestructible; and, therefore, when wood is charred,
it will remain a long time under ground without rotting. As
an antiseptic, it is powerful. It will therefore prevent the putrefaction
of bodies, and even recover tainted meat. As a
preservative of water, for sea-voyages, it has been long
known. The charring of water casks is designed for the same
purpose. The quality of wine is said to be improved by having
the casks previously charred. It possesses the property
of absorbing gases, and to this property is ascribed its use
as an antiseptic, and its disinfecting quality. To the distiller
it is useful, as it destroys effectually the burnt or empyreumatic
smell of liquor. When heated to eight hundred de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>grees
in the open air, it burns. In oxygen gas the combustion
is brilliant, forming in both instances carbonic acid gas, called
also aerial acid, fixed air, mephitic air, and calcareous
acid. This acid is formed in a variety of processes, and is
carbon saturated with oxygen.</p>

<p>Carbon exists in various states of combination, and many
of the compounds into which it enters are inflammable; hence
carbonic acid is generated in the combustion of coal, oils,
fat, &amp;c. In the form of an acid, it is abundant in various
stones, such as the calcareous carbonates, as chalk, marble,
limestone, and calcareous spar, barolite, &amp;c. all which effervesce
with acids, the carbonic acid being liberated. When
limestone is burnt, to obtain quicklime, the carbonic acid is
disengaged, for the presence of this acid distinguishes limestone
from pure lime. Carbonic acid is generated in various
processes of nature as well as art. Hence it is produced in
the respiration of animals, and is found in a gaseous state in
wells, cellars, caverns, &amp;c. It neither supports animal life,
nor combustion. In mines it is called choke damp; and the
Grotto del Cani, in the kingdom of Naples, has been long
celebrated, on account of it. This cave is in the side of a
mountain, near the lake Agnano, measuring not more than
eighteen feet from its entrance to the inner extremity; where
if a dog or other animal that holds down its head be thrust,
it is killed by the gas. Some experiments were made in this
cave with gunpowder, which see. Carbonic acid, during the
formation of alcohol, in the vinous fermentation, is generated,
and its production appears to be designed by nature to
carry off the excess of carbon, which gives rise to that phenomenon
called fermentation. When combined with water, it
forms aerated water, and with alkalies and water, the aerated
alkaline waters. Its union with bases forms salts called carbonates.
Plants have the property of decomposing it, and in
this respect nature has employed a mean of regenerating the
atmosphere, on the purity of which depends, in an eminent
degree, the very existence of animal life. The prime equivalent
of carbonic acid is 2.75, and carbonic acid is composed
of carbon 0.75 + 2.0 oxygen.</p>

<p>Carbonic acid may be decomposed when combined with a
base, as lime, by phosphorus and heat, for charcoal and a phosphate
of lime will be produced. But carbonic acid in the state
of gas may be decomposed by potassium. Five grains of potassium
will decompose three cubic inches of gas, and be
converted into potassa, producing at the same time three-eighths
of a grain of charcoal. If passed over a coil of fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
iron wire heated to redness, in a porcelain tube, and the operation
repeated, the iron will be oxidized, and the carbonic
acid changed into carbonic oxide gas.</p>

<p>Charcoal will not burn in dry chlorine. It unites with a
less proportion of oxygen, and forms carbonic oxide gas,
which burns with a deep blue flame. This combination is
formed by distilling in a red heat, a mixture of equal parts
of iron filings and chalk. This gas mixed with chlorine gas,
and exposed to the sun's rays, will unite with it, and form
chlorocarbonic acid gas. Carbon unites with azote, and
forms cyanogen, the base of Prussic acid. It unites likewise
with hydrogen in two proportions, forming the hydroguret
and the bihydroguret of carbon, both of which are carburetted
hydrogen gases. The former is obtained by distilling a mixture
of four parts of sulphuric acid, and one of alcohol. The
gas is very inflammable, and burns with great splendour; and
on that account may be used for exhibition, in an apparatus
similar to that of Cartwright. (See <a href="#FIRy"><i>Fire-works with Inflammable
air</i>.</a>) It was called by the German chemists olefiant gas.
The other species, called also the light carburetted hydrogen
gas, may be obtained by agitating the mud at the bottom of
stagnant pools; and by the distillation of moist charcoal, wood,
pitcoal, pitch, or almost any animal or vegetable substance.
The gas, used for <i>gas-lights</i>, is the same. It is usually obtained
from pit coal. We may merely observe, that the gas
used for that purpose, <i>i. e.</i> for illuminating streets, theatres,
manufactures, &amp;c. as obtained in the common method, is not
altogether the bihydroguret of carbon; but, according to the
experiments of Dr. Henry, a mixture of that gas with the
hydroguret, and occasionally carbonic oxide.</p>

<p>Carbon enters into other combinations. It exists as a component
part of gums, resins, sugar-starch, and other vegetable
products, as the vegetable acids, its union with iron forms
steel, a substance greatly used in the preparation of some fire-works,
especially in some of the <i>rains</i> and <i>stars</i>, and in the
composition of <i>brilliant fire</i>. (See <a href="#IROx"><i>Iron</i>.</a>)</p>

<p>As charcoal enters into the composition of gunpowder,
and the effective force of powder depends considerably on
the quality, as well as the proportion of charcoal, it is obvious
for this purpose, it should be as pure as possible.</p>

<p>Carbon is always obtained from some of its combinations,
as from pitch, tar, rosin, wood, and oil. Various processes
are employed for this purpose. Thus, by the combustion of
rosin and oil, as well as pitch, tar, turpentine, &amp;c. a soot is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
formed that collects, called lampblack, which is nothing more
than the carbon or charcoal. When pit-coal is <i>charred</i> in an
oven, called a coke oven, all the bitumen and sulphur contained
in it are disengaged, and a charcoal remains, called,
however, <i>coke</i>. Wood, when charred is decomposed; all the
volatile parts are disengaged with carburetted hydrogen gas,
and the woody fibre is converted into coal. This coal is more
or less dense according to the compactness of the wood.
Hard woods furnish the most solid coal, and light woods on
the contrary.</p>

<p>When the solid parts of animals, as bone, are charred, the
volatile products, principally ammonia or volatile alkali, are
dissipated, and there remains a substance called bone-black,
improperly called, <i>ivory black</i>.</p>

<p>The carbonization of wood in the common way is well
known: after it is cut to the lengths required, it is piled on
the ground in a pyramidal form, and covered with sod and
clay, leaving a place for the current of air, and the smoke.
The wood is then set on fire, and when the whole is burnt to
a coal the vents, &amp;c. are closed with sod and clay.</p>

<p>Nicholson (<cite>Chemical Dictionary</cite>) observes, that in the forest
of Benon, near Rochelle, great attention is paid to the
manufacture, so that the charcoal made there fetches twenty-five
or thirty per cent. more than any other. The wood is
that of the black oak. It is taken from ten to fifteen years old,
the trunk as well as the branches, cut into billets about four
feet long, and not split. The largest pieces, however, seldom
exceed six or seven inches in diameter. The end that rests
on the ground is cut a little sloping, so as to touch it merely
with an edge, and they are piled nearly upright, but never in
more than one story. The wood is covered all over about four
inches thick with dry grass or fern, before it is enclosed in
the usual manner with clay; and when the wood is charred,
half a barrel of water is thrown over the pile, and earth to
the thickness of five or six inches is thrown on, after which
it is left four-and-twenty hours to cool. The wood is always
used in the year in which it is cut.</p>

<p>Turf or peat has been charred lately in France, it is said,
by a peculiar process, and, according to the account given in
Sonnini's Journal, is superior to wood for this purpose.
Charcoal of turf kindles slower than that of wood, but emits
more flame, and burns longer. It boiled a given quantity of
water four times, while an equal weight of wood charcoal
boiled the same quantity but once. In a goldsmith's furnace,
it fused eleven ounces of gold in eight minutes, while wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
charcoal required sixteen. The malleability of the gold, too,
was preserved in the former instance, but not in the latter.
Iron heated red-hot by it, in a forge, was rendered more
malleable.</p>

<p>In charring wood it has been conjectured, that a portion of
it is sometimes converted into a pyrophorus, and that the explosions
that happen in powder-mills are sometimes owing to
this.</p>

<p>Bartholdi supposes, that such explosions are owing to the
formation of phosphoretted hydrogen gas, while others attribute
them to the absorption of oxygen, by the hydrogen
contained in the coal, and the consequent evolution of free
caloric. Percussion, which necessarily takes place in mixing
the materials of gunpowder by stampers, no doubt accelerates
the combustion. The addition of water, and having the charcoal
previously pulverized, will prevent such accidents. (See
<a href="#GUNx"><i>Gunpowder</i>.</a>)</p>

<p>Coal prepared in the manner above stated, is liable to many
foreign admixtures, nor can the process be so well regulated
as to produce coal of a uniform quality throughout. The
present improved process has many advantages, as experience
has proved. It consists in charring the wood in confined
vessels, made of iron. These are usually cylindrical, furnished
with an iron cover, and placed in furnaces. The pyroacetic,
formerly called the pyroligneous, acid, which is
formed in the destructive distillation of wood, is caught for
use. This acid is useful to the calico printer, dyer, &amp;c. in
making their iron liquor, and when purified, is employed in
Europe in the place of vinegar, as it is more pungent, and
highly concentrated.</p>

<p>When pine and various kinds of wood, which yield turpentine,
are carbonized, we obtain tar during the process.</p>

<p>Chaptal informs us, that tar is obtained from the wood of
the trunk, branches, and roots of the pine, which are heaped
together, covered with turf, and set on fire to produce a close
combustion, in the same manner as for making charcoal. The
oily parts which are disengaged, trickle down, and are received
in a gutter, which serves to convey them to a tub.
The most fluid part is sold under the name of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">huile de cade</span>;
and the thicker part is the tar used for paying or painting
the parts of shipping and other vessels.</p>

<p>According to the wood submitted to the process of charring,
the products are, more or less, various; but in all cases
it is only the solid part, or ligneous fibre, that furnishes the
coal. By the ordinary process we obtain sundry volatile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
products, among which are pyroacetic acid and carburetted
hydrogen gas.</p>

<p>When wood is carbonized in the usual manner, it yields
from 16 to 17 parts of charcoal in the hundred; but when
the operation is conducted in close vessels, the product is
28 per cent. a saving of eleven or twelve per cent. By this
difference in the quantity, it appears that eleven or twelve
per cent. is burnt in the common process.</p>

<p>M. Mollerat was the first who tried the experiment with
iron cylinders.</p>

<p>M. Vauquelin (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales de Chimie</cite>, tome lxvi, p. 174) has
given some observations on the carbonization of wood in
close vessels, predicated on a Memoir of M. Mollerat; both
of which are interesting. The apparatus used by M. Mollerat
is described by Thenard, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de Chimie</cite>, iii, p. 373,)
to be composed of two parts, viz: a furnace with a moveable
dome, and a cylindrical kettle, or vessel of iron sufficiently
large to contain a cord of wood. It is furnished with a cover
and pipe. The pyroacetic acid is collected. Smaller cylinders
are preferred, because the wood is ignited more readily
and the charcoal is more of a uniform quality.</p>

<p>From 100 parts of the following named woods, Messrs.
Allen and Pepys (<cite>Phil. Trans.</cite> 1807) obtained the following
proportional parts of charcoal:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%" summary="">

</table>

<p class="p1">See also the experiments of Mr. Mushet, in the third
volume of Tilloch's <cite>Magazine</cite>.</p>

<p>It appears by the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales de Chimie</cite>, vol. 66, and the
<cite>Retrospect of Discoveries</cite>, vol. vi, p. 100, that three brothers
have established at Pellerey, near Nuits, Cote d'Or, a manufactory
on a large scale, for making charcoal in close vessels.</p>

<p>The quantity of charcoal they obtained is double that by
the usual mode, while it requires only one-eighth part of
wood to be consumed in the distillation; it is also better than
the common, as a given quantity evaporates one-tenth more
water than the other; hence iron masters may obtain twice
as much iron from the use of a given quantity of wood; and
in addition to this, there is also prepared a number of other
articles, of each of which in order.</p>

<p>350 kilogrammes (700 lbs.) of wood, yield 25 or 30 of
tar, which retains so much acid that it is soluble in water;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
but when it is washed, and rendered thick by boiling, for some
time, it offers more resistance to water. If mixed with one-fifth
of rosin it is rendered equally fit for the use of ships, &amp;c.
as the common tar.</p>

<p>Four sorts of vinegar are prepared, all of which are perfectly
limpid, which do not, like the common, contain any
tartar, malic acid, resinous or extractive matter, nor indeed
any mineral acid, lime, copper, or other substances. The
simple vinegar marks&mdash;2° hydrometer for salts, at 12° centigrade
thermo. it is stronger tasted than common vinegar,
and produces a disagreeable irritation. The aromatic vinegar
is prepared with tarragon, the smell is agreeable, but
it has the same fault as the former. The vinous vinegar is
formed by adding some alcohol to simple vinegar; it has a
very sensible odour of acetic ether; the alcohol softens the
flavour in some degree, but the vinegar is still very sharp.
The acid, called strong vinegar, is in fact a very good acetic
acid at 10<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>° hydr., it is very white, clear, and sharp, without
the usual burnt flavour, and seems to form the basis of
the preceding kinds. It can be sold for 8 or 9 francs (7s.)
per lb. which is only half the price of that distilled from
verdigris. Although not so agreeable to the taste as common
vinegar, these new kinds are more elegant to the eye,
and do not mother.</p>

<p>The editor of the Retrospect makes the following observations:</p>

<p>The proprietors of this manufactory seem to be perfectly
aware of all the several productions which could be prepared
from the refuse of their principal object; and we have no
doubt but that the substances they procure in this manner
will amply compensate them for the use of the capital that
must be invested in building the furnaces.</p>

<p>The nature of the vessels in which they distil the wood is
not mentioned, but they are probably cast iron retorts, or
vessels of a similar nature, in which a distillation <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per latus</i>
takes place. The application, therefore, of lord Dundonald's
furnaces for procuring coke to this purpose would be still
more advantageous.</p>

<p>A cubic yard of wood yields 100 quarts of acid liquor,
besides 50 or 60 lbs. of thick oil.</p>

<p>The method of making charcoal of a <i>uniform quality</i>, for
which a Mr. Kurtz has taken out a patent, is the following:</p>

<p>A sheet-iron chest, which has a cover that fits it tight, and
a pipe, or tube, that descends nearly to the bottom, and coming
out from its side above, is fixed in brick work. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the billets of wood are put. Fire is then made underneath.
It is obvious, that the wood is kept at one temperature from
its being immersed in vapour, as the vapour cannot escape
at the top, but must descend to the bottom, and then proceed
up the pipe, by which it is conveyed away. The effect is,
that the charring process goes on regularly, and the wood is
charred equally. The carbonization is finished when the
vapour ceases to appear, and nothing but carburetted hydrogen
gas escapes. The charring of bones is performed in iron
cylinders, furnished with tubes to receive, and convey away,
the impure ammonia.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of powder, particular kinds of wood
are selected for carbonization. These are generally, willow,
hazle, maple, poplar, linden, buckthorn, or alder, or those
which are tender and light, because, as they are less dense,
and consequently more friable, they enflame and consume
more rapidly: they are known in the arts by the name of
<i>white wood</i>. When a less sudden effect is to be produced
with the gunpowder, and the combustion prolonged, as in
some sky-rockets, the charcoal of hard wood is to be preferred,
such as the oak, beech, &amp;c. When the wood is gathered,
the bark is removed, and the wood exposed to the
sun to dry: it is then cut into billets, and charred. The
ashes, if any be formed, are to be carefully separated.</p>

<p>In considering the use of charcoal, therefore, for the preparation
of gunpowder, we are to direct our inquiries to the
choice of wood for carbonization, and the best process for
carbonizing it. All light woods, we remarked, as the linden,
willow, poplar, &amp;c. furnish the lightest coal, and on that account
are preferred. It is remarked, that tender wood, besides
making a light, friable, and porous coal, is more combustible
than ordinary hard, and more compact wood, and
the coal that it furnishes leaves less residue after combustion.</p>

<p>Many experiments have been made with coal prepared
from different kinds of wood, with a view of ascertaining the
kind best adapted for the manufacture of gunpowder. M.
Letort, at the powder mills of Essonne, in France, instituted
a number of experiments of this kind. He made gunpowder
with the coal of several kinds of wood, and compared its
effects by a mortar eprouvette. The result was, that the
powder made with the coal of poplar, was the strongest; and
the other powder, made with the coal of the linden, willow,
&amp;c. was of the same quality throughout. As to the second
inquiry, it is hardly necessary to repeat, that for the complete
and thorough carbonization of the wood, to produce at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the same time coal of a uniform quality, the process of charring
in iron cylinders or close vessels, is to be preferred.
The point to be attended to is, to bring the wood to a complete
state of ignition, and consequently to disengage all the
volatile or fluid parts. When the gas (carburetted hydrogen)
ceases to appear, it is a criterion that the operation is finished.
This gas, it is to be recollected, will come over even after
the whole of the wood is completely ignited. The first volatile
product is the pyroacetic acid. Some saturate the acid
liquor with chalk, and decompose the acetate of lime with
sulphate of soda, and separate the acetic acid from the acetate
of soda by distillation with sulphuric acid. The acetic
acid is then tolerably pure, and may be diluted for use.</p>

<p>It is observed, however, that when charcoal, prepared in
iron cylinders, is designed for gunpowder, the last portion
of vinegar and tar must be allowed to escape, and the reabsorption
of the crude vapours prevented, by cutting off the
communication between the interior of the cylinders and the
apparatus for condensing the pyroacetic acid, whenever the
fire is withdrawn from the furnace. If this precaution be
not taken, the gunpowder made with the charcoal would be
of inferior quality.</p>

<p>On a large scale, when the object is also to prepare the
vinegar of wood, a series of cast-iron cylinders, about four
feet diameter, and six feet long, are built horizontally, in
brick-work, so that the flame of one furnace may play round
about two cylinders. Both ends project a little from the
brick-work. One of them has a disc of cast iron well fitted
and firmly bolted to it, from the centre of which disc an iron
tube about six inches diameter proceeds, and enters at a right
angle, the <i>main</i> tube of the refrigeration. The diameter of
this tube may be from 9 to 14 inches, according to the number
of cylinders. The other end of the cylinder is called
the mouth of the retort. This is closed by a disc of iron,
smeared round the edge, with clay lute, and secured in its
place by wedges. The charge of wood for such a cylinder
is about 8 cwt. The hard woods, oak, ash, birch, and beech,
are alone used. Fir does not answer. The heat is kept up
during the day-time, and the furnace is allowed to cool during
the night. Next morning the door is opened, the coal removed,
and a new charge of wood is introduced. The average
product of crude vinegar is 35 gallons. Its total weight
is about 300 lbs. But the residuary charcoal, according to
Ure, (<cite>Chemical Dictionary</cite>), from whom we have taken this

employed. The crude pyroacetic acid is rectified by a
second distillation, in a copper still, in the body of which
about 20 gallons of viscid tarry matter are left for every 100.
Its acid powers are now superior to the best household
vinegar in the proportion of 3 to 2. Ure observes, that by
distillation, saturation with quicklime, evaporation of the
liquid acetate to dryness, and gentle torrefaction, the empyreumatic
matter is so completely dissipated, that on decomposing
the calcareous salt by sulphuric acid, a pure, perfectly
colourless, and grateful vinegar rises in distillation. Pyroacetic
acid is said to be a powerful antiseptic. M. Monge, Dr. Jorg,
and more lately, Mr. Ramsay, of Glasgow, have made experiments
with it. Fish dipped in it have been preserved for
many days, and meat treated in the same manner, has also
been preserved from putrefaction.</p>

<p>With respect to the pulverization of charcoal, the operation
is so exceedingly simple, that we deem it unnecessary to notice
it. It is obvious, that mortars, mills, &amp;c. may be used, with
fine or coarse sieves. For fire-works, charcoal is frequently pulverized
in a leather sack, in the same manner as grained powder
is reduced to meal-powder. It may be made either coarse
or fine, to answer different purposes, by employing sieves of
different kinds. Charcoal may be separated from nitre and
sulphur, in gunpowder, by a simple process, which may be
seen by referring to the section on gunpowder.</p>

<p>The quantity of carbon in coal, is directly proportionate
to the quantity required for the decomposition of nitrate of
potassa, a fact necessary to be considered in the theory of the
action of charcoal in gunpowder. Thus, Mr. Kirwan found
that, 12.709 of carbon are necessary to decompose 100 of
nitrate of potassa. It will be easy to deduce the quantity of
carbon, in a given weight of coal, from the quantity of nitrate
of potassa it is capable of decomposing. The experiment is
made very readily by fusing in a crucible, five hundred or
more grains of nitre, and when red-hot projecting by degrees
the powdered coal on the nitre. When the detonation produced
by one projection of coal has ceased, add a new portion
till it produces no farther effect.</p>

<p>Charcoal may be made intensely black, resembling ivory
black, according to M. Denys-de-Montfort, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bibliothèque
Physico-Economique</cite>, for March 1815,) by pulverizing it very
fine, mixing it with wine lees, and drying the mixture, and
then subjecting it to a strong heat in a covered crucible, or
other vessel.</p>

<p class="centerx"><a name="GUNx" id="GUNx"></a><i>Sec. VII. Of Gunpowder.</i></p>

<p>Having remarked, that the quality of gunpowder depends
upon the purity of the materials, of which it is formed, and
that they should be prepared in a state of purity; the subject
that will now particularly claim our attention, is the proportions
of the ingredients, their mixture, and the final preparation
of gunpowder for use. To this, we purpose to add, the
theory of its explosive effects, the different modes of proving
it, and the experiments necessary to determine the quality
of its respective ingredients, on all which we will be as brief
as the importance of the subjects will admit. Previously,
however, it may be interesting to notice the <i>history of gunpowder</i>,
the invention of which has so completely changed
the art of war.</p>

<p>The history of gunpowder has been fully treated by
many writers of eminence; but by none more largely, and, at
the same time, more satisfactorily than by the French. Beckman,
in his History of Inventions, is full on this subject.
Our purpose is not to go into details, as it would enlarge
our volume, to the exclusion, perhaps, of other and more
important matter. We shall, therefore, confine ourselves to
a few facts and observations.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding much has been written on the subject,
the original invention of gunpowder seems to be in obscurity.
By whom, and at what time it was invented, is a question
not fully settled. It is said to have been known in the east
from time immemorial, and whatever claim Roger Bacon,
who died in 1292, may have had to the discovery, or that he
knew the properties of gunpowder, it is certain, that the use
of fire-arms was then unknown in Europe.</p>

<p>Professor Beckman, who examined all the authors extant
on the origin of gunpowder, is of opinion, that it was invented
in India, and brought by the Saracens from Africa to the
Europeans, who improved the preparation of it, and employed
it in war, as well as for small arms and cannon.</p>

<p>M. Langles, who read a memoir on this subject to the
National Institute, in 1798, observes, that the Arabians obtained
a knowledge of gunpowder from the Indians, who had
been acquainted with it from the earliest periods. The use
of it was forbidden in their sacred books, the veidam
or vede. It was employed in 690 at the battle near
Mecca. As nitre was employed in all probability in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Greek fire, invented about the year 678, it is supposed, that
that composition gave rise to the invention of gunpowder.</p>

<p>Various prescriptions, or formulæ, have been given for
the preparation of this fire. The oldest is by princess Anna
Commena, in which, however, there is only resin, sulphur,
and oil. Beckman observes, that the first certain mention
of saltpetre will be found in the oldest account of the preparation
of gunpowder, which, in his opinion, became known
in the thirteenth century, about the same time that the use
of the Greek fire, of which there were many kinds, began to
be lost. The oldest information on this subject is to be
found in the works of Albertus Magnus, and the writings of
Roger Bacon. The true recipe for making the Greek fire,
and the oldest for gunpowder, were found in a manuscript,
preserved in the electoral library at Munich. Various copies
of this manuscript were made. Bacon employed this writing,
which was mentioned by Jebb, in the preface to his
edition, from a copy preserved in the library of Dr. Mead.
Whether the writer was Marcus Græcus, is of no moment;
for Cardan observes, that the <i>fire that can be kindled by
water</i>, or rather not extinguished by water, was prepared by
Marcus Gracchus.</p>

<p>The former Marcus, mentions two kinds of fire-works; and
the composition, which he prescribes for <i>both</i>, is two pounds
of charcoal, one pound of sulphur, and six pounds of saltpetre,
well powdered and mixed together in a stone mortar.</p>

<p>Friar Bacon, who lived three centuries after Græcus, was
in possession of the recipe. It was concealed, however,
from the people, veiled in mystery. In his treatise <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Secretis
Operibus Artis et Naturæ, &amp;c.</cite> the secret of the composition
is thus expressed: "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sed tamen salispetræ, <span class="xs">LURU
MOPE CAN URBE</span> et sulphuris; et sic facies tonitrum et corruscationem,
si scias artificium</span>." <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Luru mope can urbe</i>, is the
anagram for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carbonum pulvere</i>. Bacon supposes, that it was
with a similar composition that Gideon defeated the Midianites,
with only three hundred men. Besides the use of gunpowder
in the 9th century, in the war between the Tunisians
and the Moors, in which the former are said to have
employed "certain tubes or barrels, wherewith they threw
thunderbolts of fire," the Venetians employed it against the
Genoese, and it was reprobated as a manifest contravention
of fair warfare.</p>

<p>Peter Mexia, in his "<cite>Various Readings</cite>," relates, that the
Moors, being besieged, in 1349, by Alphonso the eleventh,
king of Castille, discharged a kind of iron mortars upon them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
which made a noise like thunder. This, with the sea-combat
between the Tunisians and the Moors, stated on the authority
of don Pedro, bishop of Leon, places the invention
much earlier than by some writers.</p>

<p>Polydore Virgil ascribes the invention of gunpowder to
a chemist, who, having put some of his composition in a
mortar, and covered it with a stone, was blown up, in consequence
of its accidentally taking fire. The person here
alluded to, according to Thevet, was a monk of Friburg,
named Constantine Anelzen. Others, as Belleforet, with
more probability, hold it to be Bartholodus Schwartz, or the
black, who discovered it, as some say, about the year 1320.
Du Cange, however, remarks, that there is no mention made
of gunpowder in the registers of the chamber of accounts in
France, as early as the year 1338. Roger Bacon knew of
gunpowder, near one hundred years before Schwartz was
born. (See the invention of cannon, in <a href="#MILx"><i>military fire-works</i></a>,
fourth part.)</p>

<p>It is certain, that Albert de Bollstædt indicated the constituent
parts of gunpowder, when he says, in his <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mirabilis
Mundi</cite>, "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ignis volans, accipe libram unam, sulphuris, libras
duas, carbonas salicis, libras sex, salis petrosi, quæ tria subtilissime
terantur in lapide marmorea; postea aliquid posterius
ad libitum in tunica de papyro volante, vel tonitrum faciente
ponatur</span>.</p>

<p>"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tunica ad volandum debet esse longa, gracilis, pulvere
illo optime plena, ad faciendum vero tonitrum brevis, grossa
et semiplena</span>."</p>

<p>Gunpowder was of a much weaker composition than that
now in use, or that described by Marcus Græcus. Tartalgia,
(<cite>Ques. and Inv.</cite> lib. 3, ques. 5), observes, that, of twenty-three
different compositions, used at different times, the first,
which was the oldest, contained equal parts of the three
ingredients. When guns of modern construction came into
use, gunpowder of the present strength was introduced.</p>

<p>The strength of powder depends upon the proportions of
the ingredients, they being pure; and Mr. Napier observes,
(<cite>Trans. Royal Irish Academy, ii.</cite>) that the greatest strength
is produced, when the proportions are, nitre, three pounds,
charcoal, nine ounces, and sulphur, three ounces. The cannon
powder was in meal, and the musket powder in grain.</p>

<p>In the time of Tartalgia, the cannon powder was made of
four parts of nitre, one of sulphur, and one of charcoal; and
the musket powder of forty-eight parts of nitre, seven parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of sulphur, and eight parts of charcoal; or of eighteen parts
of nitre, two parts of sulphur, and three parts of charcoal.</p>

<p>The intimate mixture, therefore, and the determinate proportions
of saltpetre, charcoal, and sulphur, form gunpowder;
the different qualities of which, depend, as well upon
the proportions which are used, as on the purity of the
materials, and the accuracy with which they are mixed.</p>

<p>Gunpowder is reckoned to explode at about 600° Fahr;
but, if heated to a degree just below that of faint redness,
the sulphur will mostly burn off, leaving the nitre and charcoal
unaltered.</p>

<p>The <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'salpetre'">saltpetre</ins> should be perfectly refined, and entirely free
from deliquescent salts; the sulphur as pure as possible, and,
for that reason, a preference should be given, to that which
is sublimed, or distilled; and the charcoal should be prepared
in iron cylinders, as <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'decribed'">described</ins> under that head, from woods,
which are light and tender, as the linden, willow, hazle, dogwood,
etc.</p>

<p>There is a considerable difference in the proportions used
by different nations; but, from the many accurate and conclusive
experiments of the French chemists, their formula is
certainly the most perfect. In English powder, three-quarters
of the composition are nitre, and the other quarter is
made up of equal parts of charcoal and sulphur; but sometimes,
to seventy-five parts of nitre, fifteen of charcoal is used,
adding ten of sulphur. Their government powder is the
same for cannon, as for small-arms.</p>

<p>According to a number of experiments, made at Grenille,
it was found, that the proportion of saltpetre in gunpowder,
must be in a given ratio with the charcoal, so that the latter
might effectually decompose it in the act of combustion; and
hence the ratio is as 12 of the latter to 75 of the former,
and these, with 12 of sulphur, are the proportions generally
employed. Ruggeri (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pyrotechnie Militaire</cite>, p. 91,) gives,
as the proportions, 12 parts of saltpetre of the third boiling,
2 parts of charcoal, and 1 part of sulphur. The proportions,
used in Sweden, are 75 saltpetre, 9 sulphur, and 16 charcoal;
in Poland, 80 saltpetre, 8 sulphur, and 12 charcoal; in Italy,
76 saltpetre, 12 sulphur, and 12 charcoal; in Russia, 70 saltpetre,
11 sulphur, and 18<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> charcoal; in Denmark, 80
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'salpetre'">saltpetre</ins>, 10 sulphur, and 10 charcoal; in Holland, 76 saltpetre,
12 sulphur, and 12 charcoal; in Prussia and Austria, 78
saltpetre, 11 sulphur, and 11 charcoal; and in Spain, 77 saltpetre,
11<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> sulphur, and 11<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> charcoal.</p>

<p>According to Klaproth and Wolff, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire de Chimie</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
translated into French by MM. Lagrange and Vogel),
Berlin powder is composed of three-quarters nitre; one-eighth
sulphur, and one-eighth charcoal; Chinese powder, of 16
parts nitre, 6 charcoal, and 4 sulphur; Swedish powder, of
75 parts nitre, 16 sulphur, and 9 charcoal; the powder of
Lissa, of 80 nitre, 12 sulphur, and 8 charcoal; and English
powder, on the authority of Beckman, as follows: Powder
for war, 100 parts of nitre, 25 charcoal, and 25 sulphur;
musket powder, 100 nitre, 18 sulphur, and 20 charcoal;
pistol powder, 100 nitre, 23 sulphur, and 15 charcoal; strong
cannon powder, 100 nitre, 20 sulphur, and 24 charcoal;
strong musket powder, 100 nitre, 15 sulphur, and 18 charcoal;
and strong pistol powder, 100 nitre, 10 sulphur, and
18 charcoal. German powder, for war, is composed, generally,
of 0.70 saltpetre, 0.16 charcoal, and 0.14 sulphur.
A small portion of gum is sometimes added, to make the
grain firmer; but such additions retard the combustion, and
the effect.</p>

<p>The addition of gum arabic, however small, must injure
the quality of gunpowder, although it has the effect of making
the grain firmer, and less liable to fall into meal powder.
The grain is also made heavier, and less liable to absorb
moisture. M. Proust, in his second memoir on gunpowder,
mentions the use of icthyocolla, a fish glue, for the same
purpose; and, nevertheless, speaks of some advantages that
the gunpowder, prepared with it, possesses.</p>

<p>It is observed by Mr. Coleman, of the Royal Powder
Mills of Waltham abbey, that it is not exactly ascertained,
whether there is any one proportion, which ought always
to be adhered to, and for every purpose. We have no hesitation
in believing, for our own part, that the French formula
is the most correct, from the numerous experiments made
at the royal manufactory at Essone, near Paris.</p>

<p>A very considerable variation is found in the proportions
of the ingredients of the powder of different nations and different
manufactories. The powder made in England, is the
same for cannon as for small arms, the difference being only
in the size of the grains; but in France, it appears, that there
were formerly six different sorts manufactured; namely, the
strong and the weak cannon powder, the strong and the weak
musquet powder, and the strong and the weak pistol powder.
The following are the proportions in each, though
the reason of this nicety of distinction is not very obvious.
For the strong cannon powder, the nitre, sulphur,
and charcoal were in the proportions of 100 of the first, 25<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of the second, and 25 of the third: for the weak cannon powder,
100, 20, and 24: for the strong musket powder, 100,
18, and 20; for the weak, 100, 15, and 18: for the strong
pistol powder, 100, 12, and 15; for the weak, 100, 10, and
18.</p>

<p>The Chinese powder appears, by the analysis of Mr. Napier,
to be nearly in the proportions of 100 of nitre, 18 of
charcoal, and 11 of sulphur. This powder, which was procured
from Canton, was large-grained, not very strong, but
hard, well coloured, and in very good preservation.</p>

<p>The following proportions are <i>now</i> used in France, for
the manufacture of gunpowder for war, for hunting, and for
mining.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%" summary="">

</table>

<p class="p1">After having made choice of the materials, the nitre being
pulverized, is passed through a brass sieve; the sulphur is
pulverized by means of a muller, or other contrivance, and
also sifted in a bolter; the quantities are then weighed, as
well as the charcoal.</p>

<p>The mixing of these substances is performed in a series
of mortars, hollowed out of a strong piece of oak wood; and
by the aid of pestles or stampers, which are set in motion
by machinery and water power, the mixture is thoroughly
made. The end of the stampers is usually covered with,
and sometimes made of, brass, and the mortars are also, in
some powder mills, lined with brass. The mill has generally
two rows of mortars and stampers, of ten each. The
nitre, sulphur, and charcoal, in proper proportions, are put
into each mortar. The charcoal is first introduced into the
mortar, being sometimes previously pulverized; then wetted
with water, and the pounding is continued for thirty minutes.
The nitre and the sulphur are then added, and the
whole is stirred with the hand. More water is then added;
it is again stirred, and the operation of pounding is continued.
The object of adding the water is to prevent the so called
volatilization of the ingredients, and to give the mixture the
consistency of paste, and at the same time to prevent the
explosion of the powder; a circumstance, which must be
always guarded against.</p>

<p>After the operation is continued for half an hour, the
pounders are stopt, and the powder is then <i>re-exchanged</i> by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
means of copper or brass ladles; that is to say, the powder
of the first mortar is removed, and put into a box, and the
contents of the second mortar are put into the first, that of
the third is put into the second, that of the fourth into the
third, &amp;c. in succession, and in the last, the contents of the
first mortar.</p>

<p>We make, in this manner, twelve exchanges, allowing one
hour between two, and adding water from time to time, to
the mixture, and especially during the summer months. After
this, the pounders are again set in motion, for the space
of two hours, and the operation is finished. Fourteen hours
are generally required to complete the mixture, which is then
in the form of paste. It is then granulated. After being
partially dried, the graining is performed by passing it
through sieves, which are more generally formed of parchment.
These sieves are made to work horizontally, and the
powder is caught in vessels placed beneath. The size of the
grain depends on the sieve; hence, fine grain, or coarse grain
powder is thus obtained. In the sieve is usually placed a
contrivance to break the masses, and to cause the powder
to pass through in grains. After this, the powder is
again passed through a second sieve, commonly called a
<i>grainer</i>, the holes of which are of the same diameter as the
powder we wish to obtain. It is then put into another sieve,
which permits only the dust to pass, whilst the grain-powder
remains. As the powder, however, contains some grains
too large, as well as others too small, we may separate the
former by a fourth sieve, of a suitable size. The dust and
fine grain are carried to the mill, and worked over. The
powder for war, and for mining, is dried immediately after
the graining.</p>

<p>Formerly, the powder was dried in the open air, by
spreading it on tables lined with cloth, or in oblong boxes;
but serious inconveniences resulted from it, and, particularly,
the powdermakers were obliged to watch the temperature,
as well as the state of the atmosphere. When the latter
was moist, the <i>drying</i> was suspended.</p>

<p>M. Champy, however, has obviated these inconveniences
by a very advantageous process, which consists in raising
the temperature of the air to 50 or 60 degrees, and causing
it to pass from the chamber in which it is heated, through
cloths, on which is spread a bed of powder, of a certain
thickness. By this means, large quantities of powder may
be dried, in all seasons of the year, in a short time, and at
little expense. In whatever manner the <i>drying</i> is performed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
there is always more or less <i>dust</i> formed, which, to make
the grain of one uniform appearance, must be separated by
a hair sieve. This operation is called the <i>dusting</i>.</p>

<p>Whether we adopt the plan recommended by M. Champy,
or heat the rooms for the drying of powder to a certain temperature,
by means of steam pipes, a plan which presents
every advantage, or use the old mode, the effect is the same.</p>

<p>The musket, or <i>hunting powder</i>, undergoes an operation
more than the powder for war, namely, that of glazing,
which is performed before it is dried. With the exception
of this process, it is made in the same manner, using, however,
a finer sieve in granulating it. The glazing has for its
object the smoothing, or removing the asperities of the grain,
and to prevent its falling into dust, and soiling the hands.</p>

<p>The powder intended for glazing is first exposed an hour
to the sun on one cloth, in winter, and between two cloths in
summer, in order to dry it more perfectly, which is very necessary
before the operation of glazing. For this purpose,
it is put into a vessel like a barrel, which is turned horizontally
upon its axis, by machinery. This barrel is furnished with
bars that go across, intended to augment the friction, or
rubbing of the grain, and expedite the process. The barrels
are made to turn slowly, to avoid breaking the grain, and at
the expiration of eight or twelve hours, the glazing is
finished, the powder having acquired a sufficient hardness
and polish. After removing the powder, the dust is separated
in the usual manner.</p>

<p><i>Gunpowder-mills</i> are mills, in which powder is prepared,
by pounding and beating together the ingredients of which
it is composed. They are always worked by water-power,
and as there are generally many of them belonging to the
same manufactory, one dam of water will furnish a sufficient
supply. In the construction of powder-mills, the
frame of the house is made very stout, and the roof put on
lightly, so that in case of explosion, it may be carried off
easily, and thus give vent to the powder, without much injury
to the works. The lights, to enable the work to be
carried on at night, are placed on the outside of the building,
beyond the reach of the powder, and by means of glass
windows, the light passes into the mill. It is lamentable,
indeed, that so many accidents occur in the operation of making
powder. This may take place, as it has to our knowledge,
by the friction of the pounders. Their weight, the rapid
succession of the blows, and the dryness of the powder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
are the principal causes of such accidents, and sometimes by
the inattention of the workmen, suffering nails, and the like,
to get among the materials. I once witnessed the effect of an
explosion of the kind, in the neighbourhood of Frankford, in
the vicinity of Philadelphia, at the old and well-known powder
mills, at that place. It was produced, in consequence of
the friction, by the neglect of the men not adding water at a
proper time, to keep the materials moist. The mill in which
the explosion took place was not much injured; but the roof,
together with the men, were sent a considerable distance.
Some of the latter fell into the mill-race, and were much injured.
The effect, however, did not stop here; for the fire
communicated, strange as it may appear, to some of the
other mills, although at some distance, and blew them up.
Several explosions have happened at the same mills.</p>

<p>An experiment, made at the same works, by the then proprietor,
the father of the late commodore Decatur, by putting
the nitre, charcoal, and sulphur, into a barrel, with iron
balls covered with lead, which was turned upon its axis, terminated
in the same way. It exploded, but no other injury
or accident was sustained. On examining the balls, we
found, that the lead was entirely worn off, and the explosion
must have been owing to the iron. This experiment was
performed, in order to find if the mixture could be made in
this manner, a plan which was afterwards adopted in France,
with success, but brass balls were used. In a series of essays,
which I wrote for, and published in, the Aurora, in
1808, on the "<cite>Application of Chemistry to the Arts and Manufactures</cite>,"
as manufactures are vitally important to the
<i>practical</i> independence of this country, I mentioned the subject
of gunpowder, and the different modes of preparing it,
and among which, the various experiments on this subject.</p>

<p>The machinery, required in gunpowder mills, is exceedingly
simple. The power of the water, which may be given
by an overshot, or undershot wheel, is communicated to the
parts of the mill, which perform the work. Thus it is, that
pounders, like the snuff, or plaster-paris mill, are put in motion,
by a horizontal shaft, furnished, at different distances,
with pieces of wood, which, by the revolution of the shaft,
and meeting with the projecting pieces from the pounders,
raises them in succession. They fall, then, in the same order
of succession, in the respective mortars.</p>

<p>The mortars of the powder-mill, are hollow pieces of wood,
capable of holding twenty pounds of paste, composed of the
substances before mentioned, which are incorporated by means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of the pestle. There are usually twenty-four mortars in
each mill, where are made, each day, four hundred and eighty
pounds of gunpowder; care being taken, to sprinkle the
ingredients with water, from time to time, lest they should
take fire. This precaution is absolutely necessary, and if
attended to, would prevent many of the explosions, which,
unhappily, take place, in the manufacture of powder. The
friction must be great, and, therefore, the increase of temperature,
occasioned in this manner, ought to be guarded
against. This can only be done, by diminishing the time, or
number of the blows, or by proportioning the weight of the
pestle, and the frequent addition of water. The last is the
most certain, and indeed, the water is in some respects, necessary
to promote a more intimate mixture of the materials.
The observations of M. David, on the use of water in the
manufacture of powder, are certainly correct. The pestle
is a piece of wood, ten feet high, and four and a half inches
broad, armed at the bottom with a round piece of metal. It
weighs about sixty pounds.</p>

<p>Having mentioned one cause of the explosion of powder-mills,
that of friction produced by the pestle, we find that it
has been accounted for on another principle. The <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales
de Chimie</cite>, tome xxxv, mentions some instances of spontaneous
combustion in powder mills. It is well known, that charcoal
has the property of absorbing several gases, and the observations
of Rouppe and Berthollet, on this subject, are
conclusive. It is also known, that charcoal, which contains
hydrogen, when exposed to atmospheric air, will absorb oxygen,
and form water; and during this combination, heat must
be generated, by the emission of caloric from the oxygen
gas. It is said, then, that in cases of spontaneous combustion,
when nitre, sulphur, and charcoal, are mixed together,
(unless water be added to prevent it), this effect will ensue,
and fire be produced. We know, however, that percussion is
one source of heat; and in truth, if that opinion be well
founded, percussion itself may facilitate the union of hydrogen,
with the oxygen of the air, and necessarily operate
as a secondary cause of such explosions.</p>

<p>Another opinion has been advanced by Bartholdi, to account
for the spontaneous combustion in powder mills: namely,
that charcoal sometimes contains phosphorus, combined
with hydrogen, which, by the action of the pestle, is disengaged
in the form of gas, and inflames, the moment it comes
in contact with the air. Others again suppose, that it sometimes
contains pyrophorus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Pulverizing the charcoal, in the first instance, by itself,
and adding water, during its mixture, from time to time, a
measure proposed in 1808, by M. David, and now generally
adopted, will prevent such accidents; for it appears, they
have not <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'occured'">occurred</ins> in France, since the adoption of this plan.
Some remarks on spontaneous combustion, may be seen in
the article on <i>artificial volcanoes</i>.</p>

<p>M. Sage, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de Physique</cite>, vol. lxv, p. 423, or <cite>Nicholson's
Journal</cite>, vol. xxiii, p. 277), has written on the
spontaneous ignition of charcoal, and adduced some facts on
the subject; by which it appears, that M. de Caussigni was
the first, who observed, that charcoal was capable of being
set on fire, by the pressure of mill stones.</p>

<p>Mr. Robin, commissary of the powder mills of Essonne,
has given an account, in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales de Chimie</cite>, of the spontaneous
inflammation of charcoal, from the black berry bearing
alder, that took place the 23d of May, 1801, in the box
of the bolter, into which it had been sifted. This charcoal,
made two days before, had been ground in the mill, without
showing any signs of ignition. The coarse powder, that
remained in the bolter, experienced no alteration. The light
undulating flame, unextinguishable by water, that appeared
on the surface of the sifted charcoal, was of the nature of
inflammable gas, which is equally unextinguishable.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The moisture of the atmosphere, of which fresh made
charcoal is very greedy, appears to have concurred in the
development of the inflammable gas, and the combustion of
the charcoal.</p>

<p>It has been observed, that charcoal powdered and laid in
large heaps, heats strongly.</p>

<p>Alder charcoal has been seen to take fire in the warehouses,
in which it has been stored.</p>

<p>About thirty years ago, M. Sage saw the roof of one of
the low wings of the mint set on fire by the spontaneous
combustion of a large quantity of charcoal, that had been
laid in the garrets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Malet, commissary of gunpowder at Pontailler, near
Dijon, has seen charcoal take fire under the pestle. He also
found, that when pieces of saltpetre and brimstone were
put into the charcoal mortar, the explosion took place between
the fifth and sixth strokes of the pestle. The weight
of the pestles is eighty pounds each, half of this belonging
to the box of rounded bell metal, in which they terminate.
The pestles are raised only one foot, and make forty-five
strokes in a minute.</p>

<p>"In consequence of the precaution now taken," M. Sage
observes, "to pound the charcoal, brimstone, and saltpetre
separately, no explosions take place; and time is gained in
the fabrication, since the paste is made in eight hours,
that formerly required four and-twenty.</p>

<p>"Every wooden mortar contains twenty pounds of the
mixture, to which two pounds of water are added gradually.
The paste is first corned: it is then glazed, that is, the
corns are rounded, by subjecting them to the rotary motion
of a barrel, through which an axis passes: and lastly, it is
dried in the sun, or in a kind of stove.</p>

<p>"Experience has shown, that brimstone is not essential to
the preparation of gunpowder; but that which is made without
it falls to powder in the air, and will not bear carriage.
There is reason to believe, that the brimstone forms a coat
on the surface of the powder, and prevents the charcoal
from attracting the moisture of the air.</p>

<p>"The goodness of the powder depends on the excellence
of the charcoal; and there is but one mode of obtaining this
in perfection, which is distillation in close vessels, as practised
by the English.</p>

<p>"The charcoal of our powder manufactories is at present
prepared in pots, where the wood receives the immediate action
of the air, which occasions the charcoal to undergo a
particular alteration."</p>

<p>In 1724, (<cite>Coll. Academ.</cite> t. v, p. 413,) M. de Moraler proposed
a new mode of mixing the materials for gunpowder.
In 1759, M. Musy proposed another method to prevent explosions;
and in 1783, the baron de Gumprecht constructed
a very ingenious powder mill, a model of which he presented
to the king of Poland, whose approbation it received.</p>

<p>There is an account in detail, of the results of the experiments
made by MM. Regnier and Pajot Laforet, with
different fulminating powders, in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives des Découvertes</cite>,
iii, p. 337. These experiments, although interesting
in a philosophical view, cannot be of service in the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
case. They were made with gunpowder, fulminating silver,
fulminating silver and mercury combined, fulminating mercury
alone, &amp;c. See also the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bulletin de la Société d'Encouragement,
cahir 65</cite>.</p>

<p>The observations of M. Proust (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de Physique</cite> for
May, 1815) on the mixing of powder, and the consequences
that result by following the old process, may be consulted.</p>

<p>The process of manufacturing gunpowder, which we have
described, is followed in all, or the greater part of the factories
of France. It is, however, tedious, and not exempt from
danger. The same process, with some modifications or improvements,
is adopted in this country; but of all our gunpowder
manufactories, that of the messrs. Dupont of
Brandywine, Delaware, has heretofore produced the best
powder. Powder, however, equally powerful, has been made
in other factories.</p>

<p>The improved process of M. Champy, which, in many
respects, is superior to the foregoing, is the following:</p>

<p>1. The nitre, sulphur, and charcoal are first reduced, separately,
to very fine powder. This operation is performed
in barrels, which are made to turn upon their axis, similar to
the barrel-churn, and the substances are introduced gradually.
Balls, made of an alloy of copper and tin, are then
put in, which by their action reduce the substances to powder.</p>

<p>2. The second operation has for its object, the intimate
mixture of the ingredients. The quantities to be mixed are
weighed, and put into a drum with a quantity of shot, which
is made to revolve during an hour and a quarter. In this
manner, three hundred pounds of the mixture are at once
operated upon.</p>

<p>3. The mixture is then moistened with water. About
fourteen per cent. is added. It is then passed through a sieve
made with round holes, and then put into a drum, and submitted
for a half hour, to a rotary motion. A number of
small round grains are thereby formed, which are separated
from the mass by means of a sieve, the holes of which are
very small.</p>

<p>4. When a sufficient quantity of these grains are procured,
they are put into another drum, of a suitable size,
with one and a half times their weight of the original mixture.
The drum being put in motion, some water is added, which
serves to make them increase in size, by constant rubbing:
at the end of a certain time, the whole becomes granulated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
or perfectly round. The density of the grains depends on
the mixture, and the time they were kept in motion.</p>

<p>5. The powder being thus grained, is passed through
sieves, whose holes are of different diameters; and hence it
is divided into three kinds: <i>viz.</i> cannon powder, musket powder,
and fine grained powder.</p>

<p>6. Finally, the powder is dried, and preserved in the usual
manner. Its strength is equal to that made by the old process,
and is perfectly round.</p>

<p>It may be proper to observe, that this process presents
many important and decided advantages. Although, in our
description, we have not gone into details, yet the whole operation
will be seen at one view. It was practised in France,
by its inventor, M. Champy, and, besides being introduced
into the United States, it has also been adopted in Prussia.</p>

<p>M. Proust endeavoured to show, that charcoal made of
shoots or branches, makes the best powder, and will mix with
more facility with the nitre and sulphur; and in employing
the ordinary charcoal, two hours beating is necessary to obtain
a perfect mixture. The pestles, as Chaptal observes,
usually make fifty-five strokes in a minute. Their weight is
various; he gives them at eighty pounds.</p>

<p>M. Carney discovered a new process for the fabrication of
powder, and although Chaptal himself made some advantageous
changes in the process, yet the merit of the discovery
he gives entirely to Carney. The process of M. Champy,
is in some particulars the same. It will be sufficient, however,
to observe, that it is reduced to three heads: <i>viz.</i></p>

<p>1. The pulverization, and sifting of the materials;</p>

<p>2. Mixing the materials intimately in vessels similar to
casks; and,</p>

<p>3. Giving the mixture the necessary consistence, and the
final granulation.</p>

<p>For some details of the process, the reader may consult
Chaptal's <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chimie Appliqué aux Arts</cite>, tome iv, p. 145.</p>

<p>Chaptal is of opinion, that Carney's mode of fabricating
powder, presents many advantages, among which he considers
the facility of its formation, economy in the expense,
and the superiority of the powder. In a memoir on the subject,
and the formation of powder at Grenelle, Chaptal has
described the process very minutely.</p>

<p>Bottée and Riffault reduce the manufacture of gunpowder
in France to the following heads:</p>

<p>1. The mixture of the ingredients. This relates to the
manner of uniting the nitre, charcoal, and sulphur, the quan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>tity
of the composition put into each mortar, and observations
respecting the manipulation.</p>

<p>The time required for reducing gunpowder to its proper
consistency, and for effecting the mixture is termed by the
French, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Battage</i>. They are usually twenty-four hours, (or
eight according to the new mode,) in pounding the materials
to make good gunpowder. Supposing the mortar to contain
sixteen pounds of composition, it would require the application
of the pestle 3500 times each hour.</p>

<p>The order in which they are beaten, and mixed, is as before
given, and also the rechanging, or transferring the materials
from one mortar to another.</p>

<p>2. <i>Granulation</i>, (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grenage Fr.</i>) This operation consists, as
before observed, in passing the mixture through different
sized sieves, employing also parchment sieves, and afterwards
separating the dust by a fine sieve. The size of the
grain depends altogether on the sieve. Hence we have cannon-powder,
gunning or musket-powder, pistol-powder, and
mining-powder. Superfine powder is the very small grained.</p>

<p>3. <i>Glazing.</i> (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lissage Fr.</i>) This operation takes off the asperities
of the grain, renders it hard and less liable to soil
the hands, and gives it a kind of lustre. It is only used for
fine powder, such as the pistol, and hunting-powder. Cannon
powder is never glazed. It is performed in a barrel-shaped
vessel, which is made to revolve on its axis, like the ordinary
barrel-churn. The quantity of powder glazed in one of
these barrels at a time, in France, is 150 kilogrammes.</p>

<p>By the rotary motion, the grains of powder rub against
each other, by which each grain becomes smooth, and receives
a polish. According to the motion of the barrel, so
is the glazing more perfect. This, however, is regular. After
the operation, which continues several hours, the dust is
separated from the grain by a sieve. The state of the atmosphere
influences the process. If dry, the grain receives a better
polish; if wet or damp, the operation is retarded, and the
gloss imperfect. It has been customary to introduce a very
small portion of finely pulverized plumbago, (carburet of iron),
in order to give the grain a better polish. But such additions,
however small, are obviously injurious to the powder. It is
said that it prevents the absorption of moisture. Powder,
which has been glazed with black lead, (plumbago), may be
known by its peculiar shining lustre, and also by experiment.
M. Cagniard Latour made some experiments with glazed
powder, which may be seen in the work of Bottée and Riffault,
p. 233.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>4. <i>Drying.</i> (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Séchage. Fr.</i>) The drying of powder is performed
in two ways, <i>viz.</i> by exposure to the sun, and by exposure
to heat in close rooms. The English mode, that of
drying by steam pipes, MM. Bottée and Riffault are of opinion,
presents many advantages, and particularly that the powder
may be dried in all weathers, and with perfect safety.</p>

<p>The mode of drying gunpowder by the vapour of water,
(confining it, however, in iron pipes or vessels,) was suggested
in 1781, and 1787. See <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires de l'Académie des
Sciences de Suede</cite>, 1781, the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal des Savants</cite>, 1787, and
the <cite>Transactions of the Society of Arts</cite>, vol. xxiv. Mr. Snodgrass,
in the last work, gave an account of a method of communicating
heat by steam, by using pipes of cast iron, for
which the society of arts voted him forty guineas.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Chaptal
(<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Elements de Chimie</cite>) has some judicious remarks on the exsiccation
of powder.</p>

<p>The experiment made at Essonne near Paris, by M.
Champy, in 1808, on a contrivance for the drying of powder,
was satisfactory. This experiment may be seen in page
242 of Bottée and Riffault.</p>

<p>5. Dusting, (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Epoussetage</i>.) This operation is confined
merely to the sifting. It is nothing more than the separation
of the dust from the grain, which we have before noticed.
The dust is put in the mortars, and worked over.</p>

<p>6. <i>Barrelling &amp;c.</i> After the powder has gone through
the several operations described, it is then put into barrels,
and taken to the magazine.</p>

<p>After speaking of gunpowder under these heads, they
describe the manner of treating the green, (<i>verd</i>) and dry
meal powder; the police of powder establishments, for order
and economy; the workmen necessary in a powder manufactory;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
the process of making powder in the revolution;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>and for the manufacture of <i>imperial powder</i> (which contains
0.78 saltpetre 0.10 sulphur, and 0.12 charcoal); the process
of Berne, where the powder is made of 0.76 saltpetre, 0.14
charcoal, and 0.10 sulphur; the process of Mr. Champy,
noticed in this article; observations respecting different processes;
on powder magazines; gunpowder made of other
saline substances besides nitre; different modes of proving
powder, examination of powder; description of workshops,
mechanics, and utensils, &amp;c. &amp;c. with a variety of engravings.
We have merely to remark, that this work of Bottée and
Riffault (a large quarto volume, of 340 pages, besides the
plates, which make a distinct volume) ought to be in the possession
of every gunpowder manufacturer, as it contains all
the information known on that subject. Of this fact there
can be no difference of opinion, that in consequence of the
great attention paid to the subject of gunpowder in France,
not only by the government, but by scientific associations and
individuals, their knowledge generally must be more minute
and accurate, and their works, as authentic records of facts,
<i>more to be depended on</i>.</p>

<p>Besides many interesting works, and memoirs in French,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
there have appeared some valuable dissertations in the English
language. Mr. Coleman, in his paper in the Phil.
Mag. ix, p. 355, may be considered the first, who, as superintendant
of one of the Royal powder mills, was enabled to
present a body of facts on this subject.</p>

<p>As the mode of manufacturing gunpowder at the Royal
Powder Mills of Waltham Abbey, in England, may be interesting
and useful, in connection with the different processes
already given; we will introduce in this place the account
of Mr. Coleman, having extracted it from the <cite>Artist's
Manual</cite>, &amp;c. of the author, and having taken it from the
original memoir of that gentleman.</p>

<p>The ingredients of gunpowder are taken in the following
proportion, namely, 75 of saltpetre, 15 of charcoal, and 10
of sulphur. The saltpetre used is almost entirely that which
is imported from the Indies, which comes over in the rough
state mixed with earthy and other salts, and is refined by
solution, evaporation, and crystallization. After this it is
fused in a moderate heat, so as to expel all the pure water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
but none of the acid, and is then fit for use. The great use
of refining the nitre is to get rid of the deliquescent salts,
which by rendering the powder made of it liable to become
damp by keeping, would most materially impair its goodness.
The sulphur used is imported from Italy and Sicily,
where it is collected in its native state in abundance. It is
refined by melting and skimming, and when very impure,
by sublimation. It should seem that the English sulphur,
extracted in abundance from some of the copper and other
mines, is too impure to be economically used for gunpowder,
requiring expensive processes of refining.</p>

<p>The charcoal formerly used in this manufacture was prepared
in the usual way of charring wood, piles being formed
of it and covered with sods or fern, and suffered to burn
with a slow smothering flame. This method however cannot
with any certainty be depended on to produce charcoal
of a uniformly good quality, and therefore a most essential
improvement has been adopted in this country, to which the
present superior excellence of American powder may be in a
good measure attributed, which is, that of enclosing the
wood, cut into billets about nine inches long, in iron cylinders
placed horizontally, and burning them gradually to a
red heat, continuing the fire till every thing volatile is driven
off, and the wood is completely charred. But as the
pyroligneous acid, the volatile product of the wood heated
<i>per se</i>, is of use in manufacture, it is collected by pipes passing
out of the iron cylinder, and dipping into casks where
the acid liquor condenses. This acid is used in some parts
of calico-printing, chiefly as the basis of some of the iron
liquors and mordants for dark-coloured patterns. The wood
before charring is barked. It is generally either alder or
willow, or dog-wood, but there does not appear to be any
certain ground for preferring one wood to another provided
it be fully charred.</p>

<p>The above three ingredients being prepared, they are
first separately ground to fine powder, then mixed in the
proper proportions, after which the mixture is fit for the important
operation of thoroughly incorporating the component
parts in the mill. A powder mill is a slight wooden
building, with a boarded roof, so that in the event of any
moderate explosion, the roof will fly off without difficulty,
and the sudden expansion will thus be made in the least
mischievous direction. Stamping mills were formerly used
here, which consisted simply of a large wooden mortar, in
which a very ponderous wooden pestle was made to work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>,
by the power of men, or horses, or water, as convenience
directed. These performed the business with very great accuracy,
but the danger from over-heating was found to be
so great, and the accidents attributable to this cause were so
numerous, that stamping mills have been mostly disused in
large manufactures, and the business is now generally performed
by two stones placed vertically, and running on a
bed-stone or trough.</p>

<p>The mixed ingredients are put on this bed-stone in
quantities not exceeding 40 or 50 pounds at a time, and
moistened with just so much water, as will bring the mass
in the grinding to a consistence considerably stiffer than
paste, in which it is found by experience that the incorporation
of the ingredients goes on with the most ease and accuracy.
These mills are worked either by water or horses.</p>

<p>The composition is usually worked for about seven or
eight hours before the mixture is thought to be sufficiently
intimate, and even this time is often found, by the inferior
quality of the powder, to be too little. The fine powder
manufactured at Battle in Sussex, is still however made in
large mortars or stamping mills, in the old way, with heavy
lignum vitæ pestles. Only a very few pounds of the materials
are worked at a time.</p>

<p>The composition is then taken from the mills and sent to
the <i>corning-house</i>, to be corned or grained. This process
is not essential to the manufacture of perfect gunpowder,
but is adopted on account of the much greater convenience
of using it in grains than in fine dust. Here the stiff paste
is first pressed into hard lumps, which are put into circular
sieves with parchment bottoms, perforated with holes of
different sizes, and fixed in a frame connected with a horizontal
wheel. Each of these sieves is also furnished with
a <i>runner</i> or oblate spheroid of lignum vitæ, which being set
in motion by the action of the wheel, squeezes the paste
through the holes of the parchment bottom, forming grains
of different sizes. The grains are then sorted and separated
from the dust by sieves of progressive dimensions.</p>

<p>They are then <i>glazed</i> or hardened, and the rough edges
taken off, by being put into casks, filling them somewhat
more than half-full, which are fixed to the axis of a water-wheel,
and in thus rapidly revolving, the grains are shaken
against each other and rounded, at the same time receiving
a slight gloss or glazing. Much dust is also separated by
this process. The glazing is found to lessen the force of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the powder from a fifth to a fourth, but the powder keeps
much better when glazed, and is less liable to grow damp.</p>

<p>The powder being thus corned, dusted and glazed, is sent
to the stove-house and dried, a part of the process which
requires the greatest precautions to avoid explosion, which
in this state would be much more dangerous than before the
intimate mixture of the ingredients.</p>

<p>The stove-house is a square apartment, three sides of
which are furnished with shelves or cases, on proper supports,
arranged round the room, and the fourth contains a
large cast-iron vessel called a <i>gloom</i>, which projects into the
room, and is strongly heated from the outside, so that it is
impossible that any of the fuel should come in contact with
the powder. For greater security against sparks by accidental
friction, the glooms are covered with sheet copper, and
are always cool when the powder is put in or taken out of
the room. Here the grains are thoroughly dried, losing in
the process all that remains of the water added to the mixture
in the mill, to bring it to a working stiffness. This
Mr. Coleman finds to be from three to five parts in 100 of
the composition. The powder when dry is then complete.</p>

<p>The government powder for ordnance of all kinds as well
as for small arms, is generally made at one time, and always
of the same composition; the difference being only in the
size of the grains as separated by the respective sieves.</p>

<p>A method of drying powder by means of steam-pipes
running round and crossing the apartment has been tried
with success: by it all possibility of an accident from over-heating
is prevented. The temperature of the room when
heated in the common way by a gloom-stove is always
regulated by a thermometer hung in the door of the stoves.</p>

<p>The strength of the powder is sometimes injured by being
dried too hastily and at too great a heat, for in this case
some of the sulphur sublimes out (which it will do copiously
at a less heat than will inflame the powder) and the intimate
mixture of the ingredients is again destroyed. Besides if
dried too hastily, the surface of the grain hardens leaving
the inner part still damp.</p>

<p>Mr. Coleman deduces from experiment the following inferences,
namely: that the ingredients of gunpowder only
pulverized and mixed have but a very small explosive force:
that gunpowder granulated after having been only a short
time on the mill, has acquired only a very small portion of
its strength, so that its perfection absolutely depends on
very long-continued and accurate mixture and incorporation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
of the ingredients: that the strength of gunpowder does not
depend on granulation, the dust that separates during this
process being as strong as the clean grains: that powder
undried, is weaker in every step of the manufacture than
when dried: and lastly, that charcoal made in iron cylinders
in the way already mentioned, makes much stronger powder
than common charcoal. This last circumstance is of so
much consequence, and is so fully confirmed by experience,
that the charges of powder now used for cannon of all kinds
have been reduced one-third in quantity, when this kind of
powder is employed.</p>

<p>In barrelling powder, particular care must be taken to
avoid moisture, and this business is also generally reserved
for dry weather.</p>

<p>When powder is only a little damp, it may be restored to
its former goodness merely by stoving; but if it has been
thoroughly wetted, the nitre (the only one of the ingredients
soluble in water) separates more or less from the sulphur
and charcoal, and by again crystallizing, cakes together the
powder in whitish masses, which are a loose aggregate of
grains covered on the surface with minute efflorescences of
nitre. In this case the spoiled powder is put into warm
water merely to extract the nitre, and the other two ingredients
are separated by straining and thrown away.</p>

<p>The specific gravity of gunpowder is estimated by Count
Rumford to be about 1.868.</p>

<p>The strength and goodness of powder is judged of in
several ways; namely, by the colour and feel, by the flame
when a small pinch is fired, and by measuring the actual
projectile force by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eprouvette</i>, and by the distance to
which a given weight will project a ball of given dimensions
under circumstances in all cases exactly similar.</p>

<p>When powder rubbed between the fingers easily breaks
down into an impalpable dust, it is a mark of containing too
much charcoal, and the same if it readily soils white paper
when gently drawn over it. The colour should not be absolutely
black, but is preferred to be more of a dark blue with
a little cast of red. The trial by firing is thus managed; lay
two or three small heaps of about a dram each on clean
writing paper, about three or four inches asunder, and fire
one of them by a red-hot iron wire: if the flame ascends
quickly with a good report, sending up a ring of white
smoke, leaving the paper free from white specks and not
burnt into holes, and if no sparks fly off from it, setting fire
to the contiguous heaps, the powder is judged to be very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
good, but if otherwise, either the ingredients are badly mixed,
or impure.</p>

<p>Gunpowder mixed with powdered glass, and struck with
a hammer is said to explode.</p>

<p>An advertisement appeared in the public papers some
time in 1813 or 14, signed T. Ewel, addressed to powder
manufacturers, by which it appears, in the words of the advertisement,
that "he obtained from the United States a
patent right for three very simple and important improvements
in the manufacture of gunpowder, which do most
truly diminish more than one half the risk, the waste, and
the expense of the manufacture. They consist in boiling
the ingredients by steam, in incorporating them without the
objection of barrels, the danger of pounders, or the tediousness
of stones running on the edge: and in the granulation
effected by a simple machine turning by hand or water, and
graining more in a day than twenty hands, losing not a particle
of dust, and making not half the quantity for re-manufacture.
The advantages of this mode have been so great
that he had to discharge half his workmen from his manufactory,
as will be readily accounted for by those accustomed
to the tediousness and loss from graining, particularly the
press powder by the sifter and rollers, &amp;c."</p>

<p>We have not seen the plan in operation, and, therefore,
can say nothing respecting it; but it would appear, from the
description, that the process was conducted altogether by
steam. It is true, that the use of steam is no new application,
nor was it then, as it had been used in Europe for
heating of dye kettles, in soap boiling, distilling, for warming
apartments, and many other purposes. The application
to that particular use, that of the manufacture of gunpowder,
may be original as far as we know, notwithstanding steam
has been applied by means of pipes, &amp;c. as is used at present
in some manufactories, for the drying of gunpowder. Professor,
now president Cooper, of Columbia College, S. C.
(<cite>Emporium of Arts and Sciences</cite> vol. ii, p. 317) in making
some observations respecting that publication, believes, that
the application of steam to the manufacture of gunpowder
to be practicable, and in reference to the advertisement, also
a real improvement; and speaking of steam for that purpose
adds, "whether it be adopted in England or not, or whether
among the numerous patents granted for the application
of steam to the arts and manufactures of that country, I
know not."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>On a general principle of heating apartments by steam,
we may remark, that one <i>cubic foot</i> of boiler will heat about
<i>two thousand feet</i> of space, in a cotton mill, whose average
heat is from 70° to 80° Fahr. One square foot of surface
of steam pipe, is adequate to the warming of two hundred
cubic feet of space. Cast iron pipes are preferable to all
others for the diffusion of heat. For drying muslins and
calicoes, large cylinders are employed, and the temperature
of the apartment is from 100° to 130°. Dr. Black observes
that steam is the most effectual carrier of heat that
can be conceived, and will deposite it only on such bodies as
are colder than boiling water.</p>

<p>Dr. Ure (<cite>Researches on Heat</cite>) has given a new table of
the latent heat of vapours, by which it appears that the vapour
of water, at its boiling point, contains 1000 degrees,
while that of alcohol of the specific gravity, .825 contains
457°, and ether, whose boiling point is 112°, only 312.9. We
see then not only by the recent experiments of Ure, but also
those of Dr. Black, Lavoisier and Laplace, Count Rumford,
Mr. Watt and some others, that water is the best carrier of
heat, using the expression of Dr. Black, and hence is admirably
calculated for the warming of apartments and other
purposes.</p>

<p>Steam may be applied for the heating of water or other
fluids, either for baths or manufactures, and consequently for
the saltpetre and sulphur refineries, attached to a gunpowder
establishment, either by plunging the steam pipe with an open
end into the water cistern, if it be for the heating of water,
or by diffusing it around the liquid in the interval between
the wooden vessel and an interior metallic case. This last
mode is applicable to all purposes.</p>

<p>A gallon of water in the form of steam will heat 6 gallons
at 50° up to the boiling point, or 162 degrees; or one gallon
will be adequate to heat 18 gallons of the latter up to 100
degrees, making an allowance for waste in the conducting
pipe.</p>

<p>Mr. Woolf (<cite>Monthly Magazine</cite> vol. xxxii, p. 253) has
taken out a patent for a steam apparatus for various purposes,
among which that for the drying of gunpowder is
specified. This patent is considered under three heads; <i>viz.</i>
the construction of the boilers, which are cylindrical vessels
properly connected together, and so disposed as to constitute
a strong and fit receptacle for water, or any other fluid,
intended to be converted into steam, and also to present an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
extensive portion of convex surface to the current of flame,
or heated air or vapour from a fire. Secondly, of other
cylindrical receptacles placed above these cylinders, and
properly connected with them, for the purpose of containing
water and steam, and for its reception, transmission, &amp;c.
Thirdly, of a furnace so adapted to the cylindrical parts just
mentioned, as to communicate heat with facility and economy.
By means of this invention, he states, that any desired
temperature, necessary for the drying of gunpowder, may be
produced where the powder is to be dried, without the
necessity of having fire in, or so near the place as to endanger
its safety; for by employing steam only, conveyed
through pipes, and properly applied and directed, without
allowing any of it to escape into the room or apartment where
the powder is, any competent workman can produce a heat
equal to that found necessary for drying gunpowder, or
much higher if required. The heat may be regulated, to
effect the purpose, without producing the sublimation of the
sulphur, which has sometimes taken place.</p>

<p>Among the numerous patents of the late D. Pettibone are
some for ovens, both fixed and portable, for the drying of
gunpowder. Speaking of the use of heated air (<cite>Description
of the Improvements of the Rarefying air-stove</cite>, p. 19)
he observes, that powder makers would derive a very great
advantage by using rarefied air for drying their gunpowder.</p>

<p>Mr. Ingenhouz (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nouvelles experiences et observations sur
divers objects de physique</cite>) attributed the effect of gunpowder
to the simultaneous disengagement of dephlogisticated air
from the nitre, and inflammable air from the charcoal at the
moment of ignition. He followed the calculation of Bernouilli
with respect to the quantity of gas generated, <i>viz</i>:
that one cubic inch of gunpowder at the moment of inflammation,
calculating at the same time its expansion, occupies
not less than 2276 cubic inches.</p>

<p>That the effective force of gunpowder depends on the
generation and expansion of sundry gaseous fluids, is evident,
from the chemical action which takes place in the combustion.
At a <i>red</i> heat gunpowder explodes. This ensues
even in a vacuum; a fact at once conclusive, that, while it
possesses the inflammable principle, it has also the supporter
of combustion. It is to be observed that the particle
of powder which is struck by the spark, is instantaneously
heated to the temperature of ignition, and is thereby decom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>posed;
and the affinity existing between its oxygen or the
oxygen of the nitric acid, and the charcoal and sulphur produces
the principal part of the gases. The caloric thus evolved,
inflames successively, though with rapidity, the remaining
mass. The expansive force of powder, is therefore attributed
to the sudden production of carbonic acid gas, sulphurous
acid and nitrogen gas, with the water which is instantaneously
converted into steam; all of which are greatly
augmented by the quantity of caloric liberated.</p>

<p>The combustion, therefore, is owing to the action of the
charcoal and sulphur on the nitre; and the decomposition is
the effect of the union of the charcoal with a part of the oxygen
of the nitric acid, with which it forms carbonic acid, and
also with the sulphur producing sulphurous acid gas. It is
asserted, that sulphuretted hydrogen gas is also produced; if
so, there must be a sulphuret formed, which decomposes a
part of the water. After combustion, what remains is carbonate
of potassa, sulphate of potassa, and a small proportion
of sulphuret of potassa and unconsumed charcoal. Good powder,
however, should leave no very sensible residue when
inflamed: this is one of the proofs recommended. Thenard
observes, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de Chimie</cite>, ii, p. 498,) that the products of
the combustion of gunpowder are numerous; some gaseous,
and some solid. The gaseous products are carbonic acid, deutoxide
of azote (nitrous gas) and azotic gas, besides the vapour
of water; and the solid products are sub-carbonate of
potassa, sulphate of potassa, and sulphuret of potassa.</p>

<p>M. Proust considers, that nitrite of potassa, prussiate of potassa,
charcoal, sulphuretted hydrogen gas, carburetted hydrogen
gas, nitrous gas, and carbonic oxide gas may be generated
or result, as the products of the combustion, when
the materials have not been properly mixed. Our object
in all cases should be to render the materials pure, and the
proportions so accurate, as to produce the greatest possible
effect, which, of course, must depend on the formation
and the consequent expansion of the gases. The effect of
fired gunpowder is owing in a great degree to the generation
of carbonic acid gas; for while the charcoal acts primarily in
the combustion, by taking a greater part of the oxygen from
the nitric acid of the nitre, with which we have said it produces
carbonic acid; the sulphur has a secondary influence,
by forming sulphurous acid gas, although it renders the combustion
more rapid, and in this respect enables the charcoal
to act at once on the nitric acid of the saltpetre.</p>

<p>We learn then, that in gunpowder, the quantity of char<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>coal
should be such as to effect the decomposition; and, that
while the sulphur has a secondary effect, in the formation of
sulphurous acid gas, it promotes, if so we may term it, the
<i>rapid</i> combustion, and consequent action of the charcoal.</p>

<p>MM. Bottée and Riffault (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de l'art de Fabriqué la
poudre à canon, p. 197</cite>,) after making some observations on
the constitution of powder, and the action which takes
place when it is burnt, with the aeriform products that result,
give some remarks on the proportion of charcoal necessary
to decompose a given quantity of nitric acid; and conclude
generally, that in the production of carbonic acid gas, the
principal gas which is formed, while the nitric acid is decomposed,
and gives up its oxygen to the carbon, the azote
is liberated in the state of gas, and at the same time caloric
is evolved. They observe then, that the ancient formula for
the manufacture of gunpowder, as used in France, consists
of the following proportions, <i>viz</i>: 0.750 saltpetre, 0.125
charcoal, and 0.125 sulphur, which agrees with modern experiments,
although chemistry at that period was in its infancy.
M. Pelletier, a member of the National Institute, and
M. Riffault made several experiments at Essonne, on different
proportions of nitre, charcoal, and sulphur in the fabrication
of powder. It is unnecessary to state the different proportions,
made use of, or the experiments on the strength of the
powder made with the eprouvette. They observe, however,
that powder made in the following proportions, was more
satisfactory, <i>viz.</i> 0.76 saltpetre, 0.15 charcoal, 0.09 sulphur,
and 0.76 saltpetre, 0.14 charcoal, and 0.10 sulphur.</p>

<p>Before we give the gaseous products, according to these
gentlemen, it will be necessary to observe, that the quantity
of nitric acid in nitrate of potassa, is 48.62 in the hundred,
and according to Gay-Lussac, nitric acid is composed in volume
of 250 oxygen and 100 azote, or in weight of 69.488
oxygen, and 30.512 azote.</p>

<p>Using the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gramme</i> in the present instance, it appears
that 75 grammes of nitrate of potassa, the proportion of
this salt which enters into 100 grammes of gunpowder for
war, contains 36.47 grammes of nitric acid; and that this
quantity of acid is formed of 25.34 grammes of oxygen,
and 11.13 grammes of azote. That quantity of oxygen (25.34)
is disengaged from its combination with azote in the nitric
acid, at the instant of the inflammation of the powder by
the charcoal, forming carbonic acid; the constituents of which,
according to the proportions established by Gay-Lussac
and others, must be in the ratio of 27.376 of carbon and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
72.624 of oxygen. If 25.34 grammes of oxygen exist in
75 grammes of nitrate of potassa, the proportion usually
admitted, then it will require 9.55 grammes of carbon to
saturate it, so as to produce carbonic acid. It is necessary
to consider, that this is independent of any foreign earthy
or saline matter or moisture which may exist.</p>

<p>With respect to the presence of hydrogen in charcoal, the
observations of Dr. Priestley, Cruikshanks, Kirwan, Berthollet,
Gay-Lussac, Thenard, Vauquelin, Lowitz and some
others, are conclusive on that head. Lavoisier made the
quantity of hydrogen in charcoal upon an average, to be
0.125 of its weight. See <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Memoirs de la Société d'Arcueil</cite>,
tome ii, p. 343, and the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Statique Chimique</cite>, tome ii, pages 44
and 45, and also <i>charcoal</i> in a preceding section.</p>

<p>It is said, that by employing more charcoal than is necessary
to decompose the nitric acid of the nitre, the excess
passes off, not as carbonic acid, but carbonic oxide, or gaseous
oxide of carbon, which is necessarily inflamed, and
finally forms carbonic acid, as one of the products with the
carbonic acid originally formed. But the carbonic oxide,
to be changed into carbonic acid, requires in fact the oxygen
of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>If 34.89 grammes of carbonic acid result from the combustion
of 9.55 grammes of carbon, it must unite with a quantity
of oxygen, as before expressed, and according to the temperature,
be more or less expanded. The 11.13 grammes of
azote thus disengaged from its combination with oxygen, in
the nitric acid, remains, of course, in the gaseous state,
and is also expanded by caloric. The quantity of the latter
is stated by Lavoisier, to be 430 degrees, using a scale of
80 parts; and according to more recent experiments, it is
fixed at 600 degrees of the centigrade thermometer. The
experiments of Gay-Lussac are more recent, in which he has
given the dilatation of the gases, and the quantity of free
caloric evolved, which corresponds with the last data. We
have not room to insert his remarks.</p>

<p>The use of sulphur with the charcoal, in the fabrication of
powder, Bottée and Riffault state to be, (page 204) that it
inflames more rapidly than charcoal, and at a lower temperature,
which accelerates the combustion of the charcoal, and
consequently the detonation of the powder. The presence
of the sulphur augments the volume of gas, by producing
sulphurous acid gas. The proportion of sulphur in the powder
for war, is, 0.125, for musket powder, 0.10, and for mining
powder, 0.20, according to the same gentlemen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>M. Fourcroy (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Système des Connaissances Chimiques</cite>, tome
iii, p. 122.) among other products of the combustion of
powder, mentions ammonia. If ammoniacal gas be formed,
the hydrogen must proceed from decomposed water, and the
azote from the nitric acid. Prussine, cyanogen, or carburet
of nitrogen, the radical of prussic acid, may also be generated
by the union of carbon and nitrogen or azote, in the
same manner. We know that cyanogen may exist in the
form of gas; but as it is inflammable, burning with a bluish
flame mixed with purple, we may infer, nevertheless, that,
if generated, it must undergo decomposition by the process
of combustion. Although I know of no experiments on
this subject, either by Gay-Lussac, Vauquelin or Davy, all
of whom have investigated the properties of this compound
of carbon and azote, which Dr. Ure has called <i>prussine</i>; yet
it would appear, that during its combustion, the carbon is
changed into carbonic acid, and whether the azote be also
combined with oxygen, or merely set at liberty, is altogether
uncertain. Many difficulties present themselves to a complete
and satisfactory set of experiments on the gaseous products
of fired gunpowder.</p>

<p>With respect to the granulation of powder, we may observe,
that although some writers consider that granulated
powder is <i>stronger</i> than the fine powder, yet others are of
opinion, that its strength is not increased by granulation.
Grained powder is more fit for use; but the graining of it prevents
the whole of the powder from taking fire instantaneously.
Gunpowder, although prepared in the best manner, is not
wholly consumed by inflammation. However remarkable it
may appear, yet nevertheless it is true, that a considerable
portion of gunpowder fired in a confined space is thrown out
without being kindled. That gunpowder passes through a
volume of fire without being consumed, may seem incredible,
yet the fact may be proved by firing with a musket upon
snow, or upon a paper screen.</p>

<p>M. Morveau communicated to the Institute some experiments,
which may be seen in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives des Découvertes</cite>,
i, p. 269, relative to the time necessary for the inflammation
of a given mass of gunpowder, &amp;c. He infers that large grain
powder inflames more readily than the fine grain.</p>

<p>Since during the combustion of powder, gaseous bodies
more or less considerable are generated, it follows that
the full force of fired gunpowder must depend on the
maximum of the quantity of those gases; and the powder is
more strong as it is susceptible of forming more gas in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
given time. Besides the purity and the proper proportion
of the materials, the gunpowder, to produce the greatest
possible effect, should not only be intimately mixed, but dried
perfectly and with care.</p>

<p>It is a fact which is well known, that a musket, fowling
piece, &amp;c. are very apt to burst, if the wadding is not rammed
down close to the powder. Hence it is obvious, that in
loading a screw barrel pistol, care should be taken that the
cavity for the powder be entirely filled with it, so as to leave
no space between the powder and the ball.</p>

<p>Experience has shown, that if a shell is only half or two-thirds
filled with gunpowder, it breaks into a great number
of pieces, and on the contrary, if completely filled, it separates
only into two or three pieces, which are thrown to a very
great distance.</p>

<p>It is also found that the same principle, of leaving a space
for air, is applied with success in blasting rocks, and splitting
trunks of trees. If the trunk of a tree is charged with
gunpowder, and the wadding is rammed down very hard
upon the powder, in that case (unless the quantity of powder
is great,) the wadding is only driven out, and the tree remains
entire; but if, instead of ramming the wad close to
the powder, a certain space is left between them, the effects
of the powder are then such as to tear the tree asunder.</p>

<p>Addison (<cite>Travels through Italy and Swisserland</cite>) speaking
of the celebrated Grotto Del Cani, which contains carbonic
acid gas, and on that account extinguishes flame, and is
fatal to animal life, observes, that he laid a train of gunpowder
in the channel of a reed, and placed it at the bottom of
the grotto, and on inflaming it, that it burnt entirely away,
although the carbonic acid gas in the same spot would immediately
extinguish a lighted taper, snuff and all; for, he
remarks, fire is as soon extinguished in it as in water. If
gunpowder did not contain within itself that which was
necessary to produce combustion, how are we to account for
its combustion in an atmosphere of carbonic acid gas, or in
vacuo?</p>

<p>Whether gunpowder be fired in a vacuum or in air, a
permanently elastic fluid is generated, the elasticity or
pressure of which is, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cæteris paribus</i>, directly as its density.</p>

<p>Gregory, (<cite>Treatise on Mechanics, &amp;c.</cite> ii, p. 56) has given
a summary of the results of the experiments of Mr. Robins,
which we insert verbatim. "To determine the elasticity
and quantity of this fluid (the elastic) produced from the explosion
of a given quantity of gunpowder, Mr. Robins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
premises, that the elasticity increases by heat, and diminishes
by cold, in the same manner as that of the air; and that
the density of this fluid, and consequently its weight, is the
same with an equal bulk of air, having the same elasticity at
the same temperature. From these principles, and from
the experiments by which they are established (for a detail
of which we must refer to the book itself,) he concludes that
the fluid produced by the firing of gunpowder, is nearly
<span class="xs"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>10</sub></span>ths of the weight of the generating powder itself; and
that the volume or bulk of this air or fluid, when expanded
to the rarity of common atmospheric air, is about 244 times
the bulk of the said generating powder. Count Salace in
his <cite>Miscel. Phil. Math. Soc. Priv.</cite> Taurin, p. 125, makes the
proportion as 222 to 1; which he says agrees with the computation
of Messrs. Hawkesbe Amontons, and Belidor.
Hence it would follow that any quantity of powder fired
in any confined space, which it adequately fills, exerts at
the instant of its explosion against the sides of the vessel
containing it, and the bodies it impels before it, a force
at least 244 times greater than the elasticity of common
air, or, which is the same thing, than the pressure of the atmosphere;
and this without considering the great addition
arising from the violent degree of heat, with which it is
endued at that time; the quantity of which augmentation
is the next head of Robins's inquiry.</p>

<p>He determines that the elasticity of air is augmented in a
proportion somewhat greater than that of 4 to 1, when heated
to the extremest heat of red-hot iron; and supposing that the
flame of fired gunpowder is not of a less degree of heat,
increasing the former number a little more than four times,
makes nearly 1000; which shows that the elasticity of flame,
at the moment of explosion, is about 1000 times stronger
than the elasticity of common air, or than the pressure of
the atmosphere. But, from the height of the barometer, it
is known that the pressure of the atmosphere upon every
square inch is on a medium of 14<span class="xs"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>ths, and therefore 1000
times this, or 14750 lbs. is the force of pressure of inflamed
gunpowder, at the moment of explosion, upon a square
inch, which is very nearly equivalent to six tons and a
half. This great force, however, diminishes as the fluid
dilates itself, and in that proportion; viz. in proportion to
the space it occupies, it being only half the strength, when it
occupies a double space, one-third the strength, when a
triple space, and so on. Mr. Robins further supposed the
degree of heat above mentioned to be a kind of medium
heat; but that in the case of large quantities of powder the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
heat will be higher, and in very small quantities lower; and
that therefore in the former case the force will be somewhat
more, and the latter somewhat less, than 1000 times the
force of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>He further found, that the strength of powder is the same
in all variations in the density of the atmosphere: but that
the moisture of the air has a great effect upon it; for the
same quantity which in a dry season would discharge a bullet
with the velocity of 1700 feet in one second, will not in
damp weather give it a velocity of more than 12 or 1300
feet in a second, or even less, if the powder be bad, or
negligently kept. <cite>Robins's Tracts</cite> vol. i, p. 101, &amp;c. Further,
as there is a certain quantity of water, which, when mixed
with powder, will prevent its firing at all, it cannot be
doubted but every degree of moisture must abate the violence
of the explosion; and hence the effects of damp powder
are not difficult to account for.</p>

<p>The velocity of expansion of the flame of gunpowder,
when fired in a piece of artillery, without either bullet or
other body before it, is prodigiously great, viz. 7000 feet
per second. But Mr. Bernoulli and Mr. Euler think it is
still much greater.</p>

<p>Dr. Hutton, after applying some requisite corrections to
Mr. Robins's numbers, and after remarking that the powder
does not all inflame at once, as well as that about <span class="xs"><sup>7</sup>/<sub>10</sub></span>ths
of it consist of gross matter not convertible into an elastic
fluid, gives</p>

theorem which agrees remarkably well with the Doctor's numerous
and valuable experiments. (Tracts, vol. iii, p. 290, 315.)</p>

<p>In a French work entitled, "<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Mouvement Igné</cite> <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">considéré
principalement dans la charge d'une pièce d'artillerie</span>," published
in 1809, there are advanced, among other notions
which we apprehend few philosophers will be inclined to
adopt, some which may demand and deserve a careful consideration.
The author of this work observes, that if a fluid
draws its force partly from a gaseous or aeriform matter, and
partly from the action of caloric, which rarefies that aeriform
matter; then its density in proportion to its dilatation, will
follow the inverse ratios of the squares of the spaces described.
He then investigates two classes of formulæ: the
first appertains to fluids which possess simply the fluid or
aeriform elasticity, which are free from all heat exceeding the
temperature of the atmosphere. Whether there be one or
many gaseous substances signifies not, provided their temperature
agrees with that of the atmosphere; for when these
dilate they conform to the inverse of the spaces described.
The second relate to those which derive their elasticity as
well from the aeriform fluids, as from the matter of heat which
pervades them, and which are denominated <i>fluids of mixed
elasticity</i>, to distinguish them from those of simple or purely
<i>aeriform elasticity</i>. These fluids, in dilating, conform to the
inverse ratio of the <i>squares</i> of the spaces described. Thus
the celerity of action of mixed elastic fluids, is to that of simple
elastic fluids as S<sup><span class="xxs">2</span></sup> to S; whence it follows that mixed
elastic fluids are more prompt and energetic in their action
than others; and hence also is inferred why the fluid produced
by the combustion of gunpowder, is more impetuous
and more terrible in its operation than atmospheric air, however
compressed it may be. The force exerted by the caloric
to dissolve a quantity of powder, is regarded as equal
to that possessed by the fluid which results from that dissolution,
and is named the <i>force of dissolution</i> of powder by
fire: and the <i>surface of least resistance</i> is that (as of the ball,)
which yields to the action of the fluid. The gunpowder subjected
to experiment by this author, was of seven different
qualities, varying from 1000, the density of water, down to
946, the density of powder used by sportsmen. It was found
by theory, and confirmed by experiment, that the real velocity
with which the elastic fluid, considered under the volume
of the powder, and penetrated by a degree of heat capable
of quadrupling the volume, would expand, when it
had only the resistance of the atmosphere to surmount, is
2546.49 feet, that is, about 2734.4 feet English.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Comparing the several forces which were calculated for
the same quantity of powder, in three different circumstances:</p>

<p>1. When the fluid has only to surmount the atmospheric
pressure, it has a force of dissolution which is proper to it,
and which in a charge of 8 lbs. of powder (the specific gravity
944.72, for a 24 pounder,) acts upon the surface of the least
resistance with an energy equivalent to 9747.8074 lbs.</p>

<p>2. The fluid retarded in its expansion by a surface of least
resistance, whose tenacity (occasioned by the compactness
and pressure of the wadding, &amp;c.) is t = 31, acquires by its
elasticity of force = 52839.1463 lbs. at the instant when
that surface yields to its action.</p>

<p>3. If the tenacity t = 298 lbs., the force of the fluid at the
moment when the resisting surface yields to it, will be equivalent
to 417371.4275 lbs. If each of these forces be divided
by the surface of least resistance, the quotient will indicate
the equation of each filament, namely, 1st. That of the force
of dissolution = 173.63 grains; 2d. when t = 31 lbs. that of
elasticity = 923.26 grains; 3d. when t = 298 lbs. force
elastic equal to 7433.99 grains.</p>

<p>Dividing again these latter values by the length of the
charges, we shall have for the mean force of each elementary
fluid particle,</p>

<p>1. Force of dissolution, 0.14205 grains.</p>

<p>2. When t = 31 lbs. the force elastic = 0.75540 grains.</p>

<p>3. When t = 298 lbs. the force elastic = 6.08174 grains.</p>

<p>It appears, however, that equal charges of powder of the
same quality employed in the same piece, produce very different
velocities; the more considerable being the resistance
to the expansion of the fluid, the less the velocity becomes.
Thus, it is found, when t = 31 lbs. the velocity of the
ball when expelled at the mouth of the piece, is 1563.6 feet:
when t = 298 lbs. v = 1350.9 feet.</p>

<p>The following table will exhibit in one view the velocities
with which a 24 lb. ball issues from the mouth of a gun,
when propelled with the several charges expressed in the first
column.</p>

<p>1st. According to the theory developed in the volume,
from which we have made these extracts.</p>

<p>2d. According to the experiments of M. Lombard, at
Auxerre, on guns for land service.</p>

<p class="p1">It is the prodigious celerity of expansion of the flame of
fired gunpowder, which is its peculiar excellence, and the
circumstance in which it so eminently surpasses all other
inventions, either ancient or modern; for as to the momentum
of these projectiles only, many of the warlike machines of
the ancients produced this in a degree far surpassing that of
our heaviest cannon, shot or shells; but the great celerity
given to them cannot be approached with facility by any other
means than the explosion of powder."</p>

<p>Dr. Hutton, in conjunction with several able officers of the
artillery and other gentlemen, made an extensive course of
experiments at Woolwich, at the expense of the British
government, by the direction of the then master-general of
the ordnance, (the late duke of Richmond,) in the years
1783, 1784, and 1785, which demonstrated the following
facts:</p>

<p>1. That the velocity continually increases as the gun is
longer, though the increase in velocity is but very small in
respect of the increase in length; the velocities being in a ratio
somewhat less than that of the square roots of the length
of the bores, but somewhat greater than the cube roots of
the same, and nearly indeed in the middle ratio between the
two.</p>

<p>2. That the charge being the same, very little is gained
in the range of a gun, by a great increase of its length; since
the range or amplitude is nearly as the fifth root of the length
of the bore, and gives only about a seventh part more range
with a gun of double length.</p>

<p>3. That with the same gun and elevation, the time of the
ball's flight is nearly as the range.</p>

<p>4. That no sensible difference is produced in the range or
velocity, by varying the weight of the gun, by the use of
wads, by different degrees of ramming, or by firing the
charge of powder in different parts of it.</p>

<p>5. That a great difference, however, in the velocity, is oc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>casioned
by a small variation in the windage; so much so, indeed,
that with the usual windage of one-twentieth of the
caliber, no less than between one-third and one-fourth of the
whole charge of the powder escapes and is entirely lost; and
that as the windage is often greater, one-half the powder is
unnecessarily lost.</p>

<p>6. That the resisting force of wood to balls fired into it, is
not constant, and that the depths penetrated by different velocities,
or charges, are not as the charges themselves, or,
which comes to the same thing, as the squares of the velocities.</p>

<p>7. That balls are greatly deflected from the direction they
are projected in, sometimes, indeed, so much as 300 or 400
yards in a range of a mile, or almost a fourth part of the
whole range, which is nearly a deflection of an angle of 15
degrees.</p>

<p>The observations of Glenie, (<cite>History of Gunnery</cite>, 1776,)
show the theory of projectiles in vacuo by plain geometry,
or by means of the square and rhombus; with a method of
reducing projections on inclined planes, whether elevated or
depressed below the horizontal plane, to those which are
made on the horizon.</p>

<p>This author, in his treatise, after stating in page 48, the
two following positions of Mr. Robins, namely, "that till the
velocity of the projectile surpasses that of 118 feet in a second;
the resistance of the air may be estimated to be in the
duplicate of the velocity;" that "if the velocity be greater
than that of 11 or 1200 feet in a second, the absolute quantity
of the resistance will be nearly three times as great
as it should be by a comparison with the smaller velocities;"
says, that he is certain from some experiments, which he and
two other gentlemen tried with a rifle piece properly fitted
for experimental purposes, that the resistance of the air to a
velocity somewhat less than that mentioned in the first of
these proportions, is considerably greater than in the duplicate
ratio of the velocity; and that to a celerity somewhat
greater than that stated in the second, the resistance is less
than that which is treble the resistance of the same ratio.
He observes, also, that some of Mr. Robins's own experiments
come to this conclusion; since to a velocity no quicker
than 200 feet in a second, he found the resistance to be somewhat
greater than in that ratio, and remarks, therefore, that
"after ascertaining the velocities of the bullets with as much
accuracy as possible, I instituted a calculus from principles
which had been laying by me for some time before, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
found the resistance to approach nearer to that, which exceeds
the resistance in the duplicate ratio of the velocity, by
that which is the ratio of the velocity, than to that, which is
only in the duplicate ratio."</p>

<p>The experiments of Mr. Dalton, confirm the premises of
Mr. Robins, that the elasticity of the gases produced from
a given quantity of powder, is equally increased by heat
and diminished by cold as that of atmospheric air. Hence,
as we before remarked, and from direct experiments, he concludes
that the elastic fluid produced by the firing of gunpowder,
is nearly three-tenths of the weight of the powder
itself, which, expanded to the rarity of common air, is
about 244 greater than the elasticity of common air, or in
other words, than the pressure of the atmosphere. To this,
however, must be superadded the increase of expansive
power produced by the heat generated, which is very intense.
The mere conversion of confined powder into elastic
vapour, would exert against the sides of the containing vessel,
an expansive force 244 times greater than the elasticity
of common air, or, in other words, than the pressure of the
atmosphere. If the heat, for the expansion of the gases,
should be equal to that of red-hot iron, this would increase
the expansion of common air, (and also of all gases) about
four times, which in the present instance would be as we
stated in the preceding pages, 244 to nearly 1000; so that in a
general way it may be assumed, that the expansive force of
closely confined powder at the instant of firing, is 1000 times
greater than the pressure of common air; and as this latter
is known to press with the weight of 14<span class="xs"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> pounds on every
square inch, the force of explosion of gunpowder is 1000
times this, or 14750 lbs. or about six tons and a half upon
every square inch. This enormous force diminishes in
proportion as the elastic fluid dilates, being only half the
strength when it occupies a double space, one-third of the
strength when in a triple space, and so on.</p>

<p>There is one more fact worthy of notice, that Mr. Robins
found the strength of powder to be the same in all variations
of the density of the atmosphere, but not so in every state
of moisture, being much impaired by a damp air, or with
powder damped by careless keeping, or any other cause; so
that the same powder which will discharge a bullet at the
rate of 1700 feet in a second in dry air, will only propel it
about 1200 feet when the air is fully moist, and a similar
difference was observed between dry and moist powder. The
sum of these remarks, with the necessary illustrations, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
be found in the extract we have given from Gregory's Mechanics.</p>

<p>Before we mention the different modes of proving powder,
we will offer some remarks respecting the use of sulphur in
gunpowder. The conclusions on this head are drawn from
the experiments made at Essonne, near Paris.</p>

<p>The sulphur is not (properly speaking) a necessary ingredient
in gunpowder, since nitre and charcoal alone, well mixed,
will explode; but the use of the sulphur seems to be to
diffuse the fire instantaneously through the whole mass of
powder. But, if the following experiments are correct, it
should seem that the advantage gained by using sulphur in
increasing the force of explosion only applies to small charges;
but in quantities of a few ounces, the explosive, or at least the
<i>projecting</i> force of powder without sulphur, is full as great
as with sulphur.</p>

<p>The following are a few out of many trials made at the
Royal Manufactory at Essonne, near Paris, in the year 1756,
to determine the best proportions of all the ingredients. Of
powder made with nitre and charcoal alone, 16 of nitre and
4 of charcoal was the strongest, and gave a power of 9 in
the eprouvette. With all three ingredients, 16 of nitre, 4 of
charcoal, and 1 of sulphur, raised the eprouvette to 15, and
both a less and a greater quantity of sulphur produced a
smaller effect. Then diminishing the charcoal, a powder of
16 of nitre, 3 of charcoal, and 1 of sulphur gave a power of
17 in the eprouvette, which was the highest produced by any
mixture. This last was also tried in the mortar-eprouvette
against the common proof powder, and was found to maintain
a small superiority. The powder made without sulphur
in the proportions above indicated was also tried in the mortar-eprouvette,
and with the following singular result: when
the charge was only two ounces it projected a sixty pound
copper ball 213 feet, and the strongest powder with sulphur
projected it 249 feet; but in a charge of three ounces, the
former projected the ball 475 feet and the latter only 472 feet;
and on the other hand the great inferiority of force in the
smaller eprouvette of the powder without sulphur has been
just noticed.</p>

<p>It is a fact, known from time immemorial, that by the combustion
of bodies caloric is generated, or chemically speaking,
is given out in a free state; but the cause was not known
until the anti-phlogistic theory of chemistry was established,
which abolished as untenable the old doctrine of phlogiston;
The quantity of caloric, which passes from a latent to a free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
state in combustion, as combustion is nothing more than the
phenomena occasioned by this transition, is variable; and depends
therefore on the substances burnt, and the nature of
what is denominated the supporter of combustion.</p>

<p>The experiments of MM. Lavoisier and Laplace have
shown the quantity of caloric produced by the combustion
of different substances by the calorimeter, a table of which
may be seen in Thenard. (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de Chimie</cite>, &amp;c. t. i, p. 81).
From this table it appears, that while a mixture of one
pound of saltpetre with one pound of sulphur liquefied, by
its combustion, thirty-two pounds of ice, one pound of hydrogen
gas melted 313 lbs. phosphorus 100 lbs. and the same
quantity of charcoal 96.351 lbs.; and by the detonation of a
mixture of one pound of saltpetre with 0.3125 lbs. of charcoal
(French weight) melted only 12 lbs. of ice.</p>

<p>In the table of the elevation of temperature by the combustion
of different substances, the caloric being communicated
to water, (Thenard, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de Chimie</cite>, vol. i, p. 82), it
appears, that by the combustion of equal weights of hydrogen
gas, phosphorus, charcoal, and oak, the caloric produced
was as follows:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">

<p class="p1">The reader may find some interesting calculations on this
subject in Biot's <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de Physique</cite>, &amp;c. tome iv, p. 704,
and 716.</p>

<p>It appears also, that in the combustion of one pound of hydrogen
gas, six pounds of oxygen were consumed, and according
to Crawford's experiment the caloric given out melted
480 lbs. of ice. One pound of phosphorus requires for
combustion one and a half pounds of oxygen gas; one pound
of charcoal, 2.8; and one pound of sulphur, 1.36. See Thomson's
<cite>System of Chemistry</cite>, vol i, p. 133.</p>

<p>While noticing this subject we may remark, that in combustion
heat and light, according to the Lavoiserian doctrine,
are given out from the oxygen gas, while the oxygen unites
with the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'combustbile'">combustible</ins> body: which has since been modified
by supposing, that while caloric is evolved from the gas, the
light is emitted from the burning body. There are some
facts contrary to the received theory of combustion; that of
<i>gunpowder</i> furnishes one. We have also another instance in
the combustion of oil of turpentine by nitric acid.</p>

<p>Gunpowder will burn with great avidity in close vessels, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
under an exhausted receiver, and we know that the oxygen
is already combined with azote in the nitric acid of the nitrate
of potassa, and consequently not in a gaseous but a solid state;
yet we also know that a great quantity of caloric and light
are emitted during the combustion, and nearly all the products
are gaseous. The other anomaly is, that as combustion
is produced by pouring nitric acid on spirit of turpentine,
the oxygen being already combined with azote, caloric and
light are evolved by the mixture of the two fluids, from which
it is inferred, that oxygen is capable of giving out caloric and
light, not only when liquid, but even after combustion. In
the instance of gunpowder, in order to explain the combustion
which takes place independently of atmospheric air, or
any aeriform supporter, "the caloric and light," in the opinion
of Dr. Thomson, (<cite>Chemistry</cite>, i, 128) "must be supposed to
be emitted from a solid body during its conversion into gas,
which ought to require more caloric and light for its existence
in the gaseous state than the solid itself contained."&mdash;Mr.
Lavoisier (<cite>Elements of Chemistry</cite>, p. 157,) observes,
that he and M. De la Place deflagrated a convenient quantity
of nitre and charcoal in an ice apparatus, and found that
12 lbs. of ice were melted by the deflagration of one pound
of nitre. After giving the proportions of acid and alkali in
nitre, and the quantity of oxygen and azote in the acid, he
observes, that during the deflagration, 145<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span> grains of carbon
have suffered combustion along wit 3738.34 grains of
oxygen; and as 12 lbs. of ice were melted, one pound of
oxygen burnt in the same manner would have melted 29.5832
lbs. of ice. To which, if we add the quantity of caloric retained
by a pound of oxygen, after combining with carbon to
form carbonic acid gas, which was already ascertained to be
capable of melting 29.13844 lbs. of ice, we shall have for the
total quantity of caloric remaining in a pound of oxygen when
combined with nitrous gas in the nitric acid, 58.72164; which
is the number of pounds of ice, the caloric remaining in the
oxygen in that state is capable of melting. In the state of
oxygen gas it contains at least 66.66667. M. Lavoisier infers
then, that the oxygen in combining with azote to form
nitric acid, only loses 7.94502, and that "this enormous
quantity of caloric, retained by oxygen in its combination
into nitric acid, explains the cause of the great disengagement
of caloric during the deflagration of nitre; or, more strictly
speaking, upon all occasions of the decomposition of nitric
acid." This view of the subject may enable us to explain
the production of caloric, in those cases of combustion which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
cannot be explained on the ordinary principles; and, with
regard to gunpowder, the accension of oil of turpentine by
nitric acid, and similar cases, we may conclude, as the only
rationale which seems applicable, that it is nothing more than
the transition of caloric from one state to another, from a
latent to a free state. Be this as it may, the combustion in
such instances furnishes an anomaly to the already established
doctrine, of the absorption of oxygen, or the base of the
supporter, and the evolution of caloric from the gas, and not
from the combustible; or, in other words, the change of caloric
in the supporter from a combined to an uncombined state.</p>

<p>The idea of <i>latent</i> heat may be had from Dr. Black's own
expression (<cite>Black's Lectures</cite> by Robinson:) "By this discovery,"
says the doctor, "we now see heat susceptible of fixation&mdash;of
being accumulated in bodies, and, as it were, laid
by till we have occasion for it; and are as certain of getting
the stored-up heat, as we are certain of getting out of our
drawers the things we laid up in them." Murray's <cite>System
of Chemistry</cite>, 2d edition, p. 398, and Watson's <cite>Chemical Essays</cite>,
vol. iii, &amp;c. may be consulted on this subject with advantage.
See <a href="#INTx"><i>Introduction</i>.</a></p>

<p>We will consider, in the next place, the subject of <i>gunpowder
proof</i>. The first examination of gunpowder is by
rubbing it in the hands, to find whether it contains any irregular
hard lumps. If it is too black, it is a sign that it is
moist, or else, that it has too much charcoal in it; so, also, if
rubbed upon white paper, it blackens it more than good
powder does; but, if it be of a kind of azure colour, it is a
good indication. If on crushing it with the fingers, the
grains break easily, and turn into dust, without feeling hard,
it is a criterion, that it has too much coal; or, if in pressing
it under the fingers upon a smooth hard board, some grains
feel harder than the rest, it is inferred that the sulphur is not
well mixed with the nitre.  By blasting two drachms of each
sort on a copper plate, and comparing it with approved
powder. In this proof it should not emit any sparks, nor
leave any beads or foulness on the copper. The method of
<i>burning</i>, which is commonly employed, Mr. Robins observes,
is to fire a small heap on a clean board, and to attend nicely
to the flame and smoke it produces, and to the marks it
leaves behind on the boards.</p>

<p>Another trial of powder is to expose it to the atmosphere.
One pound of each sort, accurately weighed, is exposed
to the atmosphere for 17 or 18 days; during which
time, if the materials are pure, it will not increase any thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
material in weight, by attracting moisture from the air. One
hundred pounds of good powder should not absorb more
than twelve ounces, or somewhat less than one per cent. See
Mr. Coleman's account of the manufacture of powder in
England, page 110.</p>

<p>To determine the strength of powder in the easiest manner,
is by comparing its effect with improved powder; as,
for instance, by using a given weight of powder, as two
ounces, and discharging a ball of a known weight, say 64
pounds, from an 8 inch mortar. The best cylinder powder
generally gives about 180 feet range, and pit 180, with a ball
and charge of the above weights; but the weakest powder,
or powder that has been reduced, &amp;c. only from 107 to 117
feet.</p>

<p>The practice adopted in England, we are told, is, that the
merchant powder, before it is received into the king's service,
is tried against powder of the same kind made at the king's
mills, and it is received if it gives a range of <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub></span> less than
the king's powder, with which it is compared. In this comparison,
both sorts are tried on the same day, and at the same
time, and under exactly the same circumstances.</p>

<p>James (<cite>Mil'y Dictionary</cite>, p. 348) remarks, that the proof
of powder as practised by the board of ordnance, besides
that of comparing it by combustion on paper, is that 2
drachms, when put into the eprouvette, must raise a weight
of 24 pounds to the height of 3<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches.</p>

<p>According to Bottée and Riffault, before gunpowder is received
into the arsenals of France, for service, it undergoes
a variety of proofs; and the instructions for that purpose are
contained under forty-two heads, embracing, at the same
time, the specific duties of the officer employed for that service.
The principal points, however, refer to a standard
proof, made with the eprouvette, and differ, in no essential
part, from the methods practised elsewhere. There is a
uniformity in the French service, which cannot but be admired.
In every thing which relates to the ordnance especially,
even in the most minute details, the French, without
doubt, exceed any other nation.</p>

<p>Having examined the different kinds of proof, not only
for gunpowder, but for cannon and small arms, as established
by an act of parliament, it appears, that musket powder
undergoes another description of proof. A charge of four
drachms of fine grain or musket powder in a musket barrel,
should perforate, with a steel ball, a certain number of half
inch wet elm boards, placed <span class="xs"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch asunder, and the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
39 feet 10 inches from the barrel. The powder manufactured
at the Royal Powder Mills generally passes through fifteen
or sixteen, and restored powder, from nine to twelve.</p>

<p>There are other contrivances made use of, such as <i>powder-triers</i>,
acting by a spring, commonly sold at the shops, and
others again that move a great weight, throwing it upwards,
which is an imperfect kind of eprouvette.</p>

<p>Dr. Hutton is of opinion, that the best eprouvette is a
small cannon, the bore of which is about one inch in diameter,
and which is to be charged with two ounces of powder,
and with powder only; as a ball is not necessary; and the
strength of the powder is accurately shown, by the <i>arc of the
gun's recoil</i>.</p>

<p>The whole machine is so simple, easy, and expeditious,
that, as Dr. Hutton remarks, the weighing of the powder is
the chief part of the trouble; and so accurate and uniform,
that the successive repetition, or firings, with the same quantity
of the same sort of powder, hardly ever make a difference
in the recoil of the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'one-hundreth'">one-hundredth</ins> part of itself.</p>

<p>Gregory (<cite>Treatise of Mechanics</cite>, vol. ii, p. 178) has given
a more particular description of the eprouvette of Dr. Hutton;
namely, that it is a small brass gun, 2<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> feet long, suspended
by a metallic stem, or rod, turning, by an axis, on a
firm and strong frame, by means of which, the piece oscillates
in a circular arch. A little below the axis, the stem divides
into two branches, reaching down to the gun, to which
the lower ends of the branches are fixed, the one near the muzzle,
the other near the breech of the piece. The upper end
of the stem is firmly attached to the axis, which turns very
freely by its extremities in the sockets of the supporting
frame; by which means, the gun and stem vibrate together
in a vertical plane, with a very small degree of friction.
The charge is the same we have mentioned, usually about
two ounces, without any ball, and then fired; by the force of
the explosion, the piece is made to recoil or vibrate, describing
an arch or angle, which will be greater or less, according
to the quantity or strength of the powder.</p>

<p>To measure the quantity of recoil, and consequently the
strength of the powder, a circular brazen or silver arch of
a convenient extent, and of a radius equal to its distance below
the axis, is fixed against the descending two branches of
the stem, and graduated into divisions, according to the purpose
required by the machine: <i>viz.</i></p>

<p>1st. Into equal parts, or <i>degrees</i>, for the purpose of determining
the angle actually described in the vibration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>2nd. Into equal parts, according to the <i>chords</i>, being, in
fact, 100 times the double sines of the half angles, and running
up to 100, as equivalent to 90 degrees.</p>

<p>3d. Into unequal parts, according to the versed sines; they
are, in truth, 100 times the versed sines of our common tables,
141<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> corresponding with 90 degrees. These serve to
compare the forces.</p>

<p>The divisions in these scales are pointed out by an index,
which is carried on the arch during the oscillation, and then,
stopping there, shows the actual extent of the vibration.
Two ounces of powder, give, on an average, according to
the experiments of professor Gregory, about 36 on the
chords, or about 21° on the arch. A more detailed account,
with diagrams, may be seen, by consulting Hutton's Tracts,
vol. iii, p. 153.</p>

<p>The eprouvette constructed by the late Mr. Ramsden, differs
from the preceding simply by the gun's recoiling in a direction
parallel to itself, instead of its vibrating as a pendulum.
The gun is suspended by two hanging frames, which
serve to make it rise and fall, during its recoil and return,
so as always to retain the horizontal direction. The degrees
are measured upon a fixed arch, by means of a moveable index,
nearly as in Dr. Hutton's eprouvette.</p>

<p>We remarked, that the common powder-triers are small
strong barrels, in which a determinate quantity of powder is
fired, and the force of expansion measured by the action
excited on a strong spring, or a great weight. The French
eprouvette is usually a mortar of seven inches (French) in
caliber, which with three ounces of powder should throw a
copper globe of sixty pounds weight to the distance of 300
feet. No powder is admitted that does not answer this trial.
This eprouvette, however, has been improved, as we shall
mention hereafter. These methods have been objected to,
the former because the spring is moved by the instantaneous
stroke of the flame, and not by its continued pressure, which
is somewhat different; and the other, on account of the tediousness
attending its use, when a large number of barrels
of powder are to be tried.</p>

<p>J. Bodington of London, invented a machine to try the
force of gunpowder. M. the chevalier d'Arcys made an
eprouvette on the principle of Mr. Robins. M. Le Roy
proposed to employ the different elastic forces of inflammable
air, but his method has never been used. M. Tresnel
also proposed an eprouvette, which was announced in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
French journal, entitled <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nouvelles de la République des Lettres
et des Arts</cite>, par M. de la Blancherie, for 1782, p. 190.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to observe, that the eprouvette has
undergone some improvements: thus, the eprouvette of Darcy
consists of a cannon suspended at the extremity of a bar
of iron, and the graduated arc measures the recoil; the
eprouvette of Regnier is nearly the same, and the arc determines
the force of the powder.</p>

<p>A description of mortar-eprouvettes generally, may be
seen in the work of MM. Bottée et Riffault, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité sur l'art
de Fabriquer la poudre à canon</cite>,) and in the Memoirs of Proust
(<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de Physique</cite>, tome lxx, <i>et suiv.</i>), &amp;c.</p>

<p>I saw a model of an improved <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'eprovette'">eprouvette</ins>, which appeared
to possess every advantage, at the Ordnance Arsenal near
Albany; an index hand moved in an arc.</p>

<p>Quicklime is said to increase the force of powder. Dr.
Baine says, that three ounces of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'pulverized quick-lime'">pulverized quicklime</ins> being
added to one pound of gunpowder, its force will be augmented
one-third; shake the whole together, till the white colour
of the lime disappears.</p>

<p>The preservation of gunpowder in properly constructed
magazines, of which we will have occasion to speak hereafter,
is a subject that should claim our attention. The
greatest difficulty, if any, exists at sea, and on this head we
have a variety of opinions.</p>

<p>Mr. James (<cite>Military Dictionary</cite>, p. 348) says, that it has
been recommended to preserve gunpowder at sea by means
of boxes lined with sheet-lead. M. D. Gentien, a naval officer,
tried the experiment by lodging a quantity of gunpowder
and parchment cartridges in a quarter of the ship which
was sheathed in this manner. After they had been stowed
for a considerable time, the gunpowder and cartridges were
found to have suffered little from the moisture; whilst the
same quantity, when lodged in wooden cases, became nearly
half destroyed.</p>

<p>It has been recommended to line powder magazines with
lead, as a mean for preserving the powder from dampness.
The lead, it seems, so far attracts moisture, as to condense
it. In the last volume of the <cite>Transactions of the American
Philosophical Society</cite>, is a memoir on <i>leaden</i> cartridges, by
Wm. Jones, Esq. the late secretary of the navy, which, besides
preserving the powder, has advantages over either paper
or flannel. See <a href="#MAGx">Magazine.</a></p>

<p>What is termed the <i>analysis of gunpowder</i>, is nothing more
than the separation of its component parts, and determining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the relative proportions of its respective ingredients. We
may indeed examine the quality of the nitrate of potassa, by
dissolving a portion of powder in distilled water, and employing
the reagents mentioned under the head of nitre; but
for the purpose of separating, as well as determining the proportion
of saline matter, charcoal and sulphur, it may be
readily accomplished in the following manner: Take a given
quantity of gunpowder and affuse it in distilled water sufficient
to dissolve the salt; after suffering it to remain for some
time, applying heat to assist the solution, decant the whole
upon a filter of unsized paper. The saltpetre and other saline
matter will pass through, and the sulphur and charcoal
remain on the filter. By evaporating the solution to dryness,
and weighing it, the quantity of saltpetre will be found;
or, after drying the mass on the filter, and weighing it, by
subtracting its weight from that of the original, it will give
the loss sustained, which of course is the saltpetre. By exposing
the mass to a heat sufficient to evaporate the sulphur,
it will be expelled; the loss sustained will indicate its quantity,
and the weight of the residue the proportion of
charcoal. The sulphur may be even separated by subjecting
gunpowder itself to the action of a well regulated heat;
it will sublime, and leave the nitre and charcoal. It takes a
much higher temperature to inflame gunpowder than is required
to volatilize sulphur. The method of extracting the
nitre from damaged powder, we have already noticed. See
<a href="#NITy"><i>nitre</i>.</a> This process also depends on the solubility of the
nitre, and the insolubility of the charcoal and sulphur.
Bishop Watson, in his <cite>Chemical Essays</cite>, proposed the examination
of gunpowder by solution and sublimation; a process
sufficiently accurate. If it should be our object to ascertain
the presence and quantity of foreign substances, in
the saltpetre, this may be accomplished by following the process
already given, viz: by collecting the precipitates, &amp;c.
determining their weights, and making the necessary allowance,
for the new compounds, as the carbonates of lime, sulphate
of barytes, muriate of silver, and the like.</p>

<p>Baumé proposed the analysis of powder by sublimation,
in order to separate the sulphur, using however a graduated
heat. Another mode consists in distilling the powder in a
retort with water, and collecting the sulphur and sulphuretted
hydrogen gas, and then separating the charcoal, &amp;c. A
third process was recommended by Pelletier, after the separation
of the nitre, by subliming a mixture of the residue
with mercury, which, however, presents no advantages. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
use of nitric acid has also been recommended, in order to
acidify the sulphur. For this purpose nitric acid is poured
on the residue, and the whole is digested for some time, renewing
the acid as it is decomposed. By this means the
carbon, as well as the sulphur, is acidified, and carbonic acid
gas with deutoxide of azote are disengaged, leaving the
sulphuric acid formed by the union of oxygen with the sulphur,
in the remaining fluid, from which it is separated by
nitrate of barytes, and its quantity ascertained by the sulphate
of barytes produced. The proportion of sulphur, in
the sulphuric acid, is then calculated.</p>

<p>Caustic potassa has been employed for the separation of the
sulphur from the charcoal. It unites with the sulphur, forming
a sulphuret; and as sulphuretted hydrogen gas is also
produced, the sulphuret must likewise contain the hydroguretted
sulphuret of potassa. The charcoal is not acted upon.</p>

<p>M. Vito Caravelli, professor of chemistry at Naples, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Elements
d'Artillerie</cite>, 1773,) has given a more simple process
for the separation of these substances, which depends on their
specific gravity. When mixed with water, the sulphur
will deposite, and the charcoal float on the fluid.</p>

<p>Vauquelin directed his attention to this subject, and has
recommended various <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'processess'">processes</ins>, not only for the separation
of the sulphur and charcoal, but also the nitre.</p>

<p>The process of Smithson Tennant is nearly of the same
nature.</p>

<p>The separation of sulphur from charcoal may be effected
more perfectly, according to Brande, by introducing the
mixture into a small retort furnished with a stop cock, exhausted,
and filled with chlorine gas; the chlorine will unite
with the sulphur, forming a chloride, and leave the charcoal,
which may be washed, dried, and weighed.</p>

<p>Baumé found, that when all the sulphur is expelled which
will be driven off in the heat, a certain portion will still remain,
and not burn away at a lower temperature than will consume
the charcoal; so that to the last the burning residue will
smell strongly sulphurous. This retained portion of sulphur
he finds, by the results of many other experiments, to be very
uniformly about one-twenty-fourth part of the whole sulphur
employed; whence, for all common purposes, an adequate
correction may be made, by estimating that the slow weak
combustion of the residue, after the nitre has been extracted,
destroys only <span class="xs"><sup>23</sup>/<sub>24</sub></span>ths of the sulphur instead of the whole.
On trying to separate them by an alkaline solution, he found
some of the sulphur to remain undisturbed, and still adher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>ing
to the charcoal. In consequence of this circumstance,
it is recommended, to insure a perfect analysis, to separate
the nitre in the first place from gunpowder, by hot water,
and to treat the residue with nitric acid. After the sulphur is
acidified, the addition of nitrate or muriate of barytes
will separate, effectually, the sulphuric acid from the fluid,
and form a sulphate of barytes; this being collected, washed,
dried, and weighed, will give the quantity of sulphuric acid,
and of sulphur in the acid, by the well known proportion of
acid in the salt, and of sulphur in the acid. One hundred
parts of sulphate of barytes, when perfectly dry, indicate
fourteen and a half parts of sulphur; or, which is the same,
according to Chenevix, one hundred and fifty-five grains denote
twenty-two and a half grains of sulphur.</p>

<p>The observations of M. Champy and professor Proust on
<i>humid powder</i>, seem to place the quantity of water absorbed,
at 8, 10, and 14 per cent. These proportions, it is evident,
depend greatly on the quality of the nitre; and if deliquescent
salts exist in any quantity, the absorption, and consequently
the increase of weight must be greater. Chemical
examination will readily determine this fact.</p>

<p>The different sorts of gunpowder are usually distinguished
by marks on the heads of the barrels. Gunpowder
marks are various. All gunpowder for service is mixed in
proportions according to its strength, so as to bring it as
much as possible to a mean and uniform force. This sort
of powder, says Adye, (<cite>Bombardier and Pocket Gunner</cite>,) is
marked with a blue L. G. and the figure <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>; or with F. <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>
G. and the figure 3, whose mean force is from 150 to 160
of the eprouvette. This is the powder used for practice, for
experiments, and for service. The white L. G. or F. G. is
a second sort of powder of this quality. It is sometimes
stronger but not so uniform as the L. G. It is, therefore,
generally used in filling shells, or such other things as do not
require accuracy. The red L. G. F. G. denotes powder in
the British service, made at the King's mills, with the coal
made in cylinders, and is used at present only in particular
cases, and in comparisons, and to mix with other sorts to
bring them to a mean force. The figures 1, 2 or 3 denote
that the powder is made from saltpetre, obtained from the
rough. Other marks are also in use to designate the rifle,
musket, cannon powder, and the like.</p>

<p>Powder merchants recover damaged gunpowder, by putting
a part of the powder on a sail cloth, and adding an equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
quantity of good powder, which is well mixed with it, and
the mixture is then dried.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VIII. Of Lampblack.</i></p>

<p>Lampblack, which is nothing more than a finer kind of
coal, is so named from its being produced and originally
made by the combustion of oil in lamps. It is hardly necessary
to say, that it is formed in the combustion of turpentine,
various species of the <i>pinus</i>, tar, pitch, rosin, &amp;c. as all these
substances yield it more or less, and of different qualities.
It is the result of imperfect combustion; for, if the combustion
were rapid, and the smoke itself consumed, we
would then have only carbonic acid. This fact is exemplified
in the argand lamp, which, on account of the glass cylinder,
consumes its own smoke. The process of forming lampblack
is conducted in <i>lampblack houses</i>. After the combustion has
ceased, the soot or lampblack is swept down, as it collects
above and on the sides of the room. When it is obtained
by burning the dregs and coarser parts of tar, furnaces of a
particular construction are used. The smoke is conveyed
through tubes into boxes, each covered with linen, in the form
of a cone. Upon this linen the soot is deposited, from which
it is, from time to time, beaten off into boxes, and afterwards
packed in barrels for sale. There is also a very fine black,
superior in many respects to lampblack, especially in making
the ink for copperplate printers, prepared by carbonizing
grape stalks, &amp;c. in close iron vessels.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of lampblack in common use. One is
the light soot, from burning wood, of the pine and other resinous
kinds, usually made in Sweden. In Sweden the impure
turpentine is also burnt for this purpose. It is collected
from incisions made in pine and fir-trees, and the turpentine
is boiled down with a small quantity of water, and strained,
while hot, through a bag; and while this part is used for
another purpose, the dregs and pieces of bark remaining in
the strainer, are burnt in a low oven, whence the smoke is conveyed
through a long passage into a square chamber, which
contains a sack, as above stated, where the greater part of the
lampblack collects, and the remainder is caught in the chamber.</p>

<p>The other kind of lampblack is formed by carbonization,
a process similar to that for preparing the black, called <i>blue-black</i>,
from grape stalks, or for preparing the German black,
a pigment made by charring principally the lees of wine and
husks of grapes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>The lampblack made in Philadelphia, for the purpose of
printers' ink, is prepared by the combustion of tar. One barrel
of Carolina tar will produce forty pounds of soot or
lampblack.</p>

<p>A patent was granted 1798 to a Mr. Row, (<cite>Repository of
Arts</cite>, vol. x.) for a newly invented mineral lampblack. It is
nothing more than the smoke obtained by the combustion of
pit coal. In the county of Sarrbrook on the Rhine, are some
establishments for making coke and lampblack at the same
time; and from 100 lbs. of coal, 33 lbs. of coke, and 3<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> of
lampblack are obtained. Jeanson (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives des Découvertes</cite>,
&amp;c. i, p. 21) has described a process for carbonizing oil.</p>

<p>Lampblack has the same chemical properties as charcoal,
and being remarkably fine, and containing sometimes a portion
of oil, is used on that account in the composition of some
fire-works. Its quality may be known by its colour, and,
when burnt, leaving no residue. It may be sufficient to remark,
that like charcoal, it decomposes nitric acid; and the
nitrates, when mixed with it, and projected into a red-hot
crucible, will deflagrate or produce a vivid combustion. It
may therefore be used in all kinds of fire-works, in which
charcoal is employed. Concentrated nitric acid, when poured
on lampblack, previously dried, will produce combustion. It
is to the carbon, as well as the hydrogen, in oil of turpentine,
that turpentine inflames when brought in contact with nitric
acid; and although much charcoal is deposited, yet a considerable
part passes off in the state of carbonic acid gas. By
a proper treatment, lampblack like charcoal may be converted
into artificial tannin by nitric acid. It has also antiseptic
qualities; but to be used for this purpose it should first be
exposed to heat, in order to drive off any oil which it may
have contracted, or with which it might be contaminated.
The quality of lampblack may, we suspect, be improved by
bringing it to a state of ignition in close iron vessels. If required
intensely black, as for the making of printers' ink,
this process might be advantageously used. Mixed with
gum water, it makes a durable writing ink, or, according to
Mr. Close, by mixing it with a solution of copal in oil of lavender.
This ink is not, like the common kind, acted upon
by acids.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. IX. Of Soot.</i></p>

<p>Soot, or that substance formed by the combustion of wood,
&amp;c. which collects in chimnies, is used in some of the pyro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>technical
preparations, partly to assist the flame, and partly to
modify its appearance. It is found, that soot, produced by
the combustion of wood, is formed by the condensation of
the carbon evolved in the smoke. It also contains volatile
products, the nature of which, depends on the kind of combustible.
Wood-soot is considered a good manure, on account
of the carbon and some volatile salts, it is said to contain.
That it contains ammonia, is evident, since it may be
detected by experiment; and that this alkali is combined with
carbonic acid, and sometimes with muriatic acid, a number
of facts prove. Soot, then, when used in fire-works, may,
like sal ammoniac, but in a lesser degree, produce a particular
coloured flame. When soot is well washed in water, in order
to free it from saline and other soluble matter, and probably
from pyroacetic acid, and then pulverized, it forms the
pigment called <i>bistre</i>. It is a fact, that the excrement of
some animals, the camel for instance, which feed on saline
vegetables, when burnt, will yield a soot, which contains
an abundance of muriate of ammonia, or sal ammoniac.
Hence, by re-subliming this soot, sal ammoniac was originally
prepared in Egypt. The quantity of muriate of ammonia,
contained in the soot of camels' dung, is considerable. It is
found that 26 lbs. of soot yield on an average 6 lbs. of that salt;
See <a href="#SALx"><i>Sal Ammoniac</i>.</a> Camels' dung, and in fact the dried excrement
of animals, furnish a very good fuel. In Egypt it
is used with advantage. The soot of oil, &amp;c. is of a different
kind; it is the substance, which forms our lampblack.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. X. Of Turpentine, Rosin, and Pitch.</i></p>

<p>All these substances enter into the composition of fire-works,
either to increase the rapidity of combustion, as in incendiary
fire-works, or, in some cases, as with rosin, to produce
a coloured flame. That they contain carbon and hydrogen,
as their principal ingredients, is well known; to
which we may attribute their rapid combustion, and the facility
with which they decompose nitrous salts. The Greek
fire, for example, owed, it is said, its powerful effect to turpentine,
which, with other substances employed, made the
composition remarkably inflammable, and the decomposition
of the nitre, (which some say it contained) so rapid, as even
to defy the action of water.</p>

<p>All of the turpentines are obtained from different species
of pinus. Common turpentine is the resinous juice, which
exudes chiefly from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pinus Sylvestris</i>, or Scotch fir, and
is obtained by boring holes into the trunks of the trees, early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
in the spring, and placing vessels beneath for its reception.
This turpentine, and in fact all others, are composed of rosin
and a volatile oil. The latter is obtained by distilling the turpentine
with water. It passes over with the water, from which
it is afterwards separated, and is then known by the name of
the essential oil, or spirit of turpentine. The substance, remaining
in the still, is common rosin, or yellow rosin, known
likewise by the names of <i>fidlers' rosin</i> and <i>colophony</i>. Tar
is also obtained from the roots and refuse parts of the fir
tree, by cutting them in billets, piling these in a proper manner,
in pits or ovens, formed for the purpose, covering them
partly over, and setting them on fire. During the combustion,
a black and thick matter, which is tar, falls to the bottom,
and is conducted into barrels.</p>

<p>Pitch is nothing more than tar boiled down to a solid
consistence; it is usually made, however, by melting together
coarse hard rosin, and an equal quantity of tar. The
ancient pitch possessed a flavour and fragrance. White
pitch is the same as the white turpentine.</p>

<p>Melted pitch, sulphur, and camphor, mixed, when nearly
cold, with pulverized saltpetre, and afterwards thinned with
spirit of turpentine, will form a composition, that is very
inflammable, and will almost resist the action of water. A
similar composition must have formed the Greek fire, of
which, according to Beckman, there were several kinds.</p>

<p>The turpentine trees furnish various products: Thus, the
Pinus Abies, or spruce fir, yields the Burgundy pitch, and its
branches produce the Essence of Spruce; but other species
of pinus are used for the same purpose, which are nearly
allied to it, and which grow abundantly in Canada. From
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pinus laryx</i>, or larch, Venice Turpentine is obtained;
but that sold, is usually made by melting rosin, and adding
the spirit of turpentine. From the sap of the larch, the
Russians prepare a gummy substance, known in Russia by
the name of <i>Orenburg gum</i>. Turpentine is extracted in
France, in great quantity, from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pinus maratima</i>. Gallipot,
colophony, tar, pitch, &amp;c. are likewise obtained from it.</p>

<p>The turpentine of cedar, according to Dr. Pocoke (<cite>Travels
through Egypt</cite>) was employed by the Egyptians for embalming,
the operation being performed in several ways. It
was injected, and used with salt, nitre, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Pitch, tar, and turpentine all enter into sundry compositions,
used in war. The different incendiary preparations,
noticed in the last part of the work, are composed, in general,
of either one or all of these substances. Their use is obvious.
Being very inflammable, and brought in contact with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
gunpowder, nitrate of potassa, &amp;c. they burn with great rapidity,
and consume every thing before them. Hence the
tourteaux of the French, tarred links, and fascines, carcasses,
&amp;c. owe their effect to the presence of these substances.</p>

<p>Rosins are considered to be volatile oils, saturated with
oxygen.</p>

<p><i>Thus</i>, or <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'frankincese'">frankincense</ins>, of which there are several varieties,
has been long used in fire-works; it is frequently employed
in the composition of odoriferous fire. It is obtained from
the pinus abies, and appears in <i>tears</i>. During winter, the
wounds made in fir trees become incrusted with a brittle
substance, called <i>barras</i> or <i>gallipot</i>, consisting of rosin united
with a small portion of oil. All rosins, according to the
experiments of Gay-Lussac, and Thenard, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Recherches
physico-chimiques</cite>) are composed of a great quantity of carbon
and hydrogen, united with a small quantity of oxygen.
To this, we attribute their great inflammability, and it enables
us to account for the rapid decomposition of nitre, in
those preparations, in which nitre and resinous substances are
employed. See <a href="#GENx"><i>General Theory of Pyrotechny</i></a>, sec. ii.</p>

<p>For the accension which takes place by mixing oil of turpentine
and nitric acid, see the properties of nitric acid, under
the head of <a href="#NITz"><i>nitre</i>.</a></p>

<p>Morey (<cite>Silliman's Journal</cite>, vol. ii, p. 121) observes, that
a small quantity of spirit of turpentine being added to a
mixture of iron-filings, sulphuric acid, and water, the hydrogen
gas produced, will burn with a very pleasant white
flame, and without smoke. He also observes, that, if the vapour
of spirit of turpentine be made to pass through a tube,
covered at the upper end with a fine wire gauze, it burns
with much smoke; but, if a quantity of atmospheric air be allowed
to mix with it, the smoke ceases, and the flame continues
white. If more still be added, the flame lessens, and
becomes partly blue. By adding still more and more, it will
burn with a very small flame, entirely blue, and with a singular
musical sound. If still more be added, the flame, and
every ray of light cease; but that the combustion still continues,
is certain, from the explosive detonating noise, continuing
to be distinctly heard.</p>

<p>Mr. Morey further remarks, that, if tar, containing a
considerable proportion of water, is dropped on brick or
metal, at a temperature, which will readily evaporate them,
the vapours will burn with white shooting streaks, much
flame, and without smoke, while the water lasts. Inflamed
drops of tar, burn, while falling, with a red flame, and much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
smoke; but, on reaching boiling water, the smoke instantly
disappears, and streaks of a white flame shoot up. He also
says, that, if water in one cylinder be made to boil, and the
steam be led to the bottom of another, containing rosin, or
tar, at a high temperature, after passing up through it, the
water, together with the vapourized portion of the rosin or
tar, will, when the preparations are properly regulated, burn
with an intense <i>white</i> flame, and <i>no smoke</i>; much the greater
part of which appears, (by alternately shutting the steam out,
or letting it in) to be derived from the water; and also, that
if steam be led over the surface of tar in a cylinder, and
made to force out a small stream of it through a pipe, into
which a quantity of steam is also admitted, and made to mix
intimately with it, they burn, with a great body of flame and
intense heat, and without smoke, provided the proportions are
well regulated. These facts are remarkable, and may probably
lead to some useful applications. That water is decomposed,
appears more than probable. If water is thrown, in considerable
quantities, on oil or tar, in a state of inflammation,
as Morey observes, the flame is greatly increased; and if
ever so small a drop of water fall into oil at a temperature
near boiling, an explosion will take place. He draws the following
conclusion, from these circumstances; that we have
only to pass the steam of water through oil, heated to the
temperature, at which it boils, or takes fire, to produce combustion.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="COAx" id="COAx"></a><i>Sec. XI. Of Common Coal, or Pitcoal.</i></p>

<p>All the variety of coals, belonging to the coal family, are
composed principally of charcoal and bitumen, with small
quantities of earthy, and metallic matter. Whether we consider
the formation of coal, the localities or situation in which
it occurs, whether in beds or strata, accompanying other
minerals, such as clay-slate, bituminous schistus, sandstone,
&amp;c. is of no moment, except so far as the situation in which
it is found, indicates or determines its character and qualities.
The different kinds of coal owe their variety to the presence
or absence of bituminous matter, whether great or small,
the quantity of the carbonaceous ingredient, and the presence
or absence of anthracite, and other foreign substances. Coal,
which is, or ought to be preferred in fire-works, should contain
the greatest quantity of bituminous matter; and, while
it contains the due proportion of carbon, should be entirely
free from anthracite. Coal, and all other inflammable fossils,
are characterized by their inflammability, insolubility in
water, alcohol, and acids, and by their specific gravity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
which scarcely exceeds 2, unless loaded with foreign matter.
Coal surcharged with bitumen, burns with a bright flame,
and, by distillation, affords more carburetted hydrogen gas,
which is used for <i>gas light</i>. Common coal, or pitcoal, burns
in cakes, more or less, during combustion. Besides charcoal
and bitumen, it contains sometimes pyrites, sulphate of iron,
and earth. Slate-coal, however, contains more clay.</p>

<p>The collieries, from which pitcoal is obtained, are more
or less extensive in England, and elsewhere. Immense beds
of coal are found near Pittsburgh, and Richmond. The Lehigh,
and other localities in the United States, produce it also
in abundance, but of various qualities. Coal districts, or places
in which it is found, may be considered a valuable acquisition
to a country; and as coal is so essential in many
manufactories, it is a satisfaction to know, that our resources
in this particular, are almost inexhaustible;&mdash;a fact, which
shows, that, while our national industry is the main pillar of
national independence, in its true acceptation, the arts, which
require a supply of coal, will, for centuries to come, be abundantly
furnished with it.</p>

<p>When coal is exposed to the action of heat, in iron retorts
or cylinders for the preparation of coal gas, or when it is
exposed to heat in coke-ovens, the bitumen, &amp;c. are disengaged,
and there remains a coal called coke. Coke, therefore,
is nothing more than charred pitcoal.</p>

<p>Mr. Mushet made some valuable experiments on the carbonization
and incineration of coals. He found that the
Scotch cannel-coal afforded 56.57 volatile matter, 39.43
charcoal, and 4 ashes; while the stone-coal, found under basalt,
gave 16.66 volatile matter, 69.74 charcoal, and 13.6
ashes, and oak wood, 80.00 volatile matter, 19.5 charcoal,
and 0.5 ashes. The quantity of gas, however, depends entirely
on the quality of the coal. A temperature of about 600°
to 700° is sufficient to disengage it. A pound of good
cannel coal, properly treated in a small apparatus, will yield
five cubic feet of gas, equivalent in illuminating power to a
mould candle, six in the pound. One pound of coal, on a
large scale, affords only 3<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> cubic feet of gas. A gas jet,
which consumes half a cubic foot per hour, gives a steady
light equal to that of a candle of the above-mentioned size.</p>

<p>The cannel coal, known in Scotland by the name of parrot
coal, is very inflammable, takes fire immediately, and produces
a brilliant flame. It is used by the poor as a substitute for
candles. This coal, we have seen, furnishes an abundance of
carburetted hydrogen gas. It has the appearance of jet, and
admits of being turned in a lathe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Stone coal, Kilkenny coal, Welch coal, and glance coal consist
almost entirely of charcoal; and hence, when laid on
burning coals, they become red-hot, emit a blue lambent
flame, in the same manner as charcoal, and at length are
wholly consumed, leaving behind a portion of red ashes.
They burn without smoke or soot.</p>

<p>The pitch coal, which has a brownish-black colour, and is
generally found massive in plates, the bovey coal, called
brown coal, and bituminous wood, with the anthracite coal,
and some others of lesser note, form the remaining varieties
of coal.</p>

<p>When coal is employed in fire-works, it is to be pulverized,
and sifted in the usual way. For some purposes it is preferred
to charcoal, in consequence of the bitumen it contains,
which appears to contribute to the rapidity of the combustion.
It is to be observed, that, as the base of coal is carbon, its action
is the same as charcoal, and therefore, by producing the
same effects, or nearly so, as charcoal itself, the phenomena
it presents are analogous. As 12.709 parts of carbon, according
to Kirwan, are required to decompose 100 parts of
nitrate of potassa, we may readily ascertain the quantity of
real carbon in any specimen of coal. According to Kirwan,
50 grains of Kilkenny coal will decompose 480 grains of nitrate
of potassa, from which it is inferred, that ten grains
would have decomposed 96 of nitrate of potassa, precisely
the same quantity of charcoal, which would have produced
the same effect. Therefore, Kilkenny coal is composed almost
entirely of carbon. Cannel coal, when treated in the
same manner with nitrate of potassa, left a residuum of 3.12
in the hundred parts of earthy ashes; and 66.5 of it were required
to decompose 480 grains of nitrate of potassa, but 50
of charcoal would have been sufficient. From this experiment,
it appears, that 66.5 grains of cannel coal contain 50
grains of charcoal, and 2.08 of earth; the remaining 14.42
grains must be bitumen. In a similar manner, by knowing
the quantity of coal required to decompose a given quantity
of nitrate of potassa, when melted in a crucible, the quantity
of carbon in any variety of this substance may be ascertained.</p>

<p>With respect to the earthy and metallic ingredients of
coal, we may ascertain them by burning the coal, with free
access of air. What remains unburnt must be considered an
impurity. Its weight may be ascertained, and its nature by
analysis. As the object, however, is generally to determine
the relative proportion of combustible matter, or carbon,
which different species of coal are capable of yielding, that
point may be determined in the manner already stated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>That coal originates from vegetables, whatever opinion
may be formed to the contrary, we may fairly infer from a
variety of vegetable remains, and impressions of animals
that are both found in the strata of coal, and in earthy strata
above and below them. Of its submarine origin, there can
also be no doubt; or why do we find in it shells, the impression
of fish, and other productions of the ocean? That coals
<i>grow like vegetables</i>, an opinion with the uninformed, is contrary
to fact, and the nature of things.</p>

<p>We may notice, in this place, another substance which
sometimes is found partially carbonized; we mean turf.</p>

<p>Turf or peat, obtained from morasses, consists of a multitude
or congeries of vegetable fibres, partly in a decomposed
state, and is frequently so inflammable as to inflame by a
spark. Very extensive morasses are found in some countries
from which the inhabitants are supplied with fuel. Some
improvements in the manner of preparing turf for use, have
been made; that of charring it in kilns is one. By this process
it kindles sooner, burns with less air, and forms a moderate
and uniform fire, without much smoke, though it is
not so lasting as that produced by turf. The method of reducing
turf to coal is still practised in some parts of Bohemia,
Silesia, and Upper Saxony, which was first proposed in
1669, by John Joachim Becher, who also recommended, at
that time, a process for depriving coals of their <i>sulphur</i>, by
burning them in an oven, and the use of the oil procured from
them. What are our modern patents on this subject? What are
lord Dundonald's coke ovens and coal tar? Are they original?
Boyle (<cite>Usefulness of Natural Philosophy</cite>,) speaks of Becher's
invention. Anderson, (<cite>History of Commerce</cite>,) however,
observes, that something of the kind was attempted before
Becher's time; for in the year 1627, John Hacket and Octavius
Strada obtained a patent for their invention of rendering
coals as "useful as wood for fuel in houses, without hurting
any thing by their smoke."</p>

<p>With respect to turf, it appears that Hans Charles von
Carlowitz, to save wood, introduced the use of it in Saxony,
in the smelting houses, in 1708.</p>

<p>Turf has been known for a long time. It was used from the
earliest periods, in the greater part of Lower Saxony, and
throughout the Netherlands; as is fully proved by Pliny's
account of the Chauci, who inhabited that part of Germany.
Pliny (<cite>Hist. Nat. lib.</cite> xvi, c. i.) observes, that they pressed
together with their hands, a kind of mossy earth which they
dried by the wind rather than by the sun, and which they
used, not only for cooking their victuals, but also for warming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
their bodies. We also read that a morass in Thessaly, having
become dry, took fire, and the same thing ensued in some part
of Russia, where a morass burned several days and did much
damage. Very dry turf is nearly as inflammable as spunk,
and when prepared with nitre, has been used for the same
purpose. See <a href="#PYSx"><i>Pyrotechnical sponge</i>.</a></p>

<p>Ure (<cite>Chemical Dictionary</cite>) observes, that "turf has been
charred lately in France, it is said by a peculiar process, &amp;c."
The truth is, that the <i>charring</i> of turf is by no means a recent
invention, as we stated above. Sonnini (<cite>Journal</cite>, &amp;c.)
says, that it is superior to wood. It kindles slower than charcoal
of wood, but emits more flame and burns longer. In a
gold-smith's furnace, it fused eleven ounces of gold in eight
minutes, while wood charcoal required sixteen.</p>

<p>Turf frequently contains phosphoric acid; for bogs or morasses,
and bog-iron ores abound, more or less with it, in
different states of combination. The <i>siderite</i> of Bergmann
which he supposed to be a peculiar metal, and found in bog-ore,
is a phosphate of iron. The native Prussian blue, which
also occurs in such localities, is generally admitted to be a
combination of phosphoric acid iron and alumina.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="NAPx" id="NAPx"></a><i>Sec. XII. Of Naphtha, Petroleum, and Asphaltum.</i></p>

<p>Naphtha, petroleum, and asphaltum are all modifications of
bituminous oil; and as they are all inflammable, naphtha
being the most so, they have been used in the preparation of
fire-works.</p>

<p>It will be sufficient to remark, that naphtha or rock oil is
a yellow or brownish bituminous fluid, of a strong, penetrating
odour, and so light as to float on spirits of wine. By
exposure to the air, it acquires the consistence of petroleum.
It takes fire on the approach of a lighted taper, and burns
with a bluish flame, yielding a thick smoke. Plutarch and
Pliny both affirm, that the substance with which Medea destroyed
Creusa, the daughter of Creon, was naphtha. She
sent a dress to the princess, which had been immersed in,
or covered over with the oil, and which burst into flames as
soon as she approached the fire of the altar.  Plutarch relates
that Alexander the great, was amused and astonished
with the effects of naphtha, which were exhibited to him at
Ecbatana. On the shores of the Caspian sea, it is burnt in
lamps, instead of oil. There are copious springs of this oil
in that neighbourhood, and it is sometimes obtained by distilling
bituminous substances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Hanway (<cite>Travels through Russia into Persia</cite>, i, 263,)
mentions the naphtha of Baku, and remarks that the earth
is strongly impregnated with it; for, he adds, by taking up
two or three inches of the surface, and applying a live coal,
the part which is so uncovered, immediately takes fire, almost
before the coal touches the earth. Eight horses were consumed
by the fire from naphtha, being under a roof where
the surface of the ground was turned up, and, by some accident
took fire. A cane, or tube, even of paper, set two inches
in the ground, and the top of it touched with a live coal, and
blown upon, immediately emits a flame, without hurting either
the cane or paper, provided the edges be covered with
clay. Three or four of these lighted canes will boil water
in a pot.</p>

<p>Pinkerton, (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Petralogia</cite> ii, p. 148,) speaks of the naphtha
of Baku, which exists on the western side of the Caspian sea,
being carried to Constantinople, "where it formed the chief
ingredient of the noted composition called the Grecian Fire;
which, burning with increased intensity under water, became
a most formidable instrument against an inimical fleet." See
<a href="#GREx"><i>Greek fire</i>.</a></p>

<p>Naphtha is obtained of several qualities by suffering it to
remain in pits or reservoirs. The Persians, who use it in their
lamps, and to boil their food, find it to burn best with a
small mixture of ashes. They keep it at a small distance
from their houses, in earthen vessels, under ground, to prevent
any accident by fire, of which it is extremely susceptible.</p>

<p>Hanway speaks also of what is called the <i>everlasting fire</i>,
about ten miles from Baku, which is an object of devotion to
the followers of Zoroaster. Near the altar of their temple,
he observes, is a large hollow cane, from the end of which issues
a blue flame, which the Indians pretend has continued
to burn ever since the flood, and which, they fancy, will last
to the end of the world.</p>

<p>We have no hesitation in believing, that the ancients made
use of this oil in their exhibitions; and, from its properties,
that when mixed with other substances, it would make a
brilliant fire-work.</p>

<p>Petroleum, called also mineral tar, is less fluid and less
transparent than naphtha. It has an oily consistence, more
or less viscid. It occurs of a black or brown colour. It
burns rapidly, but not so readily as naphtha, and exhales a
black smoke. By distillation, it forms a liquid like naphtha,
and leaves a thick tar in the retort.</p>

<p>It exudes from rocks, is found in wells, &amp;c. In Pegu,
the wells furnish annually 400,000 hogsheads. It is used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
there in the place of oil for lamps. When boiled with rosin,
it is used for painting houses, and the bottoms of vessels.
In the embalming of dead bodies, it was employed by the
ancient Egyptians; and, in some countries, clay, soaked in it,
is used as fuel.</p>

<p>It is found in the United States, in Kentucky, Ohio, the
western parts of Pennsylvania, in New York at the Seneca
lake, &amp;c. The Seneca or Genessee oil is the same bitumen.</p>

<p>When petroleum is exposed to the atmosphere, it acquires
a greater degree of consistence, and passes into another bituminous
substance, called maltha. This has the properties,
and frequently the appearance of pitch. When burnt, it
yields more smoke and soot than petroleum. According to
its original meaning, it signifies a kind of cement; and the
maltha mentioned by Pliny, Heineccius, Festus, and others,
which was employed in the same manner as our modern sealing
wax, was a mixture of pitch and wax, and was also used
to make reservoirs, pipes, &amp;c. water-tight. Maltha also
sometimes resembles wax. Mr. Kirwan, however, gave it
the name of mineral tallow.</p>

<p>Mineral or Barbadoes tar is somewhat thicker than petroleum,
and nearly of the consistence of common tar. It is
used for the same purposes as the ordinary petroleum. Elastic
bitumen, a variety between the softer and harder bitumens,
resembles caoutchouc. It burns with a bright flame,
and bituminous odour.</p>

<p>Asphaltum, or solid bitumen, is much harder than pitch,
brittle, and of a brownish-black colour. It burns freely, and
leaves but little residue. In Judea, it is found on the waters
of the Dead sea, or the lake of Asphaltes. It is also called
<i>Jews' pitch</i>. It was employed by the Egyptians for embalming
under the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mumia mineralis</i>.</p>

<p>Both maltha and asphaltum were used by the ancients as a
cement. The walls of Babylon were cemented with these
substances, as obtained from the river Is, which falls into the
Euphrates. It may be observed, that those countries, which
yield bitumen, contain salt springs, and it frequently accompanies
pyrites. Limestone, particularly the black, contains
it, and the colour is often owing to its presence. The <i>stink
stone</i>, or bituminous carbonate of lime, is of this kind. The
retinasphaltum, a combination of bitumen and earth, having
a yellow colour, burns with a bright flame, and fragrant
odour, which at last becomes bituminous. Many stones,
and particularly some of the black marbles, owe their colour
to bitumen; hence they burn white. The bituminous schistus,
or bituminous shale, sometimes contains so much of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
this substance as to burn in the fire. Jet is a mineral of a
black colour, and resembles the cannel coal. It is inflammable,
producing a green flame, with a strong bituminous
odour.</p>

<p>With respect to bitumens, we may observe, that they all
possess one character, that of being inflammable; and that
they are more or less so in proportion as they partake of the
principle of naphtha; or, at least, the rapidity of their combustion
depends upon the presence of this oil. The following
additional facts, therefore, with respect to naphtha, may
be interesting: Certain liquids have the property of uniting
with naphtha, which has also the property of dissolving and
combining with solid substances, of which the following examples
may be stated:</p>

<p>At the degree of ebullition, it dissolves sulphur, which, on
cooling, is in part deposited in needle-form crystals. At the
same temperature, it also dissolves phosphorus, part of which
is again separated.</p>

<p>It unites also with iodine. With camphor, it also combines,
and in large quantity. It takes up a much larger proportion
of pitch. In the cold, its action on wax is feeble,
but assisted by heat, it unites with it in all proportions. On
lac and copal, its action is feeble. In the cold, it does not
dissolve caoutchouc; but when assisted by heat, it dissolves
this substance, though not completely. These facts may
determine its action in certain mixtures.</p>

<p>According to Theodore de Saussure's Analysis, (<cite>Bibliot.
Universelle</cite>, iv, p. 116), it appears, that naphtha is composed
of 87.60 carbon, and 12.78 hydrogen.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XIII. Of Oil of Spike.</i></p>

<p>This oil is principally used as a vehicle for mixing the ingredients
of some kinds of fire-works; and, although it is employed
in that way, yet it has also an effect in combustion,
having similar properties with liquid bitumen. It enters into
the composition of some of the preparations, and perhaps is
equally good as liquid bitumen. Indeed, the oil of spike, as
sold in the shops, and used principally by farriers as an embrocation
for horses, is an artificial preparation, made by mixing
together about five ounces of Barbadoes tar, with a pint
of the spirit of turpentine.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XIV. Of Amber.</i></p>

<p>Amber, succinum, karabe, the electron of the ancients,
which are synonimous terms, is very inflammable. A piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
of it, put on the point of a knife, and set on fire, will burn
entirely away, emitting, at the same time, a white smoke, and
a somewhat agreeable odour. It is used in the composition
of fire-works, and particularly in some kinds of rockets. All
the preparation it undergoes, when thus used, is to reduce
it to powder in a mortar, and to pass it through a fine sieve. It
also forms a part of the composition of odoriferous fire; but
the formulæ for the latter are various.</p>

<p>Amber is of various colours, either yellowish, white, or
honey-yellow. It is translucent, and sometimes transparent.
It may be turned or polished. It occurs in grains or in irregular
masses. Alluvial deposites of sand, gravel, &amp;c. frequently
contain it. It is also found with bituminous wood,
brittle lignite, or jet, and with other substances. It has been
discovered in New-Jersey, near Trenton, in alluvial soil.
Naturalists believe, that amber was once a resinous juice.
Masses weighing 20 lbs. have been found. Sometimes it
contains insects. It is formed into beads and the like. As
amber becomes electric by friction, and the ancients called it
electron, the term electricity is derived from it. By distillation,
it yields both an acid, (the succinic), and an oil. Jet is
usually considered black amber.</p>

<p>We may introduce here a few remarks respecting ambergris:</p>

<p>Ambergris is a substance, which has a peculiar fragrance,
and for that reason is used as a perfume, and may be employed
like similar substances in odoriferous fire. As to its origin,
we have no certain account; but it seems, from its general
properties, to be formed in the same manner as bituminous
substances, although it is mostly found on the sea-shore,
where it has been probably washed up from the sea.</p>

<p>Ambergris is found principally on the shores of Ceylon,
and is known to be good, by laying some of it on a very hot
knife, when, if pure, it will not only melt and run like wax,
but entirely evaporate, leaving no residue.</p>

<p>Ambergris, on account of its price, (the retail price in
London being a guinea per ounce), is frequently adulterated
with various mixtures of benzoin, labdanum, meal, &amp;c.
scented with musk. But pure ambergris, when heated, has a
greasy feel, and appearance, and is soluble in hot ether and
alcohol.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XV. Of Camphor.</i></p>

<p>Camphor is a resinous substance, although generally called
a gum, which has a peculiar, and powerful smell. It is ob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>tained
principally from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laurus Camphora</i>. It is extracted
from this, and other trees in the East Indies. We
are informed, that, in Borneo and Sumatra, the larger pieces
which contain the most camphor, are picked out with sharp
instruments. The Chinese cut off the branches, chop them
small, and place them in spring water. They are then boiled,
and stirred with a stick. As soon as the camphor is observed
to adhere to the stick, the fluid is strained. It is
then poured into a basin, and the camphor separates, in
Japan, the roots and the extremities of the branches are
steamed. It is also obtained by sublimation. The roots,
wood, and leaves are all boiled in large iron pots, and the
camphor is collected on straw, placed in a tubular head.</p>

<p>With respect to the refining of crude camphor, in order
to produce <i>heads</i>, as they are called, and to free it from impurities,
the operation is nothing more than sublimation.
Sublimers made of glass are used; and into each, the camphor,
along with a small portion of lime, is introduced, and
they are then placed in a sand bath. Heat is applied, and the
pure camphor rises and attaches itself to the upper part
of the vessel, forming the refined camphor.</p>

<p>The general properties of camphor are the following: It
is not altered by the atmospheric air, but is volatilized during
warm weather. It is insoluble in water; is soluble in
alcohol, forming the spirit of camphor, and also in volatile
and fixed oils. It is not acted upon by the alkalies. It is dissolved
in acids without effervescence, and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'by some. It is'">by some it is</ins> decomposed.
Nitric acid converts it into a peculiar acid, called
the camphoric. It melts between 300 and 400 degrees. It
takes fire, and burns with a white flame, and, generally,
while it presents the character of a resin, it shows, by its
combustion, like other inflammable bodies, that it contains,
in its composition, a large quantity of carbon and hydrogen.</p>

<p>There are several species of camphor, which have been
examined by chemists and which differ in their properties.
These are, common camphor, the camphor of volatile oils,
and the artificial camphor, formed by treating oil of turpentine
with muriatic acid.</p>

<p>The base of camphor forms a constituent part of some
volatile oils, which are in a liquid state; and for its separation,
it appears to require a combination with oxygen.</p>

<p>Camphor may be apparently set on fire by means of water,
an experiment, which is nothing more than producing chemical
action by it, in the following manner: Put a portion of
nitrate of copper on some tin-foil, along with camphor; then
by adding some water, and quickly wrapping the foil up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
pressing the edges close, it will inflame, and sparks of fire be
produced.</p>

<p><a name="CANx" id="CANx"></a>Camphor has been used in the manufacture of candles.
For this purpose, it is dissolved in brandy, and the wick,
composed of equal parts of cotton and linen, is dipped in.
It is then dried, and covered, in the usual manner, with
tallow or wax. The tallow, recommended as the best for
candles, is a combination of equal parts of mutton and beef
suet.</p>

<p>Camphor is very soluble in acetic acid, which is highly
inflammable. This solution is decomposed by water. When
combined with essential oils, it forms aromatic vinegar.
Romieu has observed that small pieces of camphor floating
on water have a rotary motion.</p>

<p>Camphor enters into a composition, which is used to determine,
like a barometer, the state of the weather, and the
changes it undergoes. According to the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de Pharmacie</cite>,
1815, some experiments were made in France on the
fluid taken out of one of the English weather <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'guages'">gauges</ins>. The
liquid contained water and alcohol, was strong with camphor,
and reddened litmus paper. The tube contained 3<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>
ounces. On analysis, its contents were found to be, 24 grains
of alum, 120 grains of camphor, and enough water to dissolve
the former, and alcohol to dissolve the latter. A similar
composition was made, and put into a tube, which, it
seems, had the same effect. The tube is hermetically sealed.
M. Cadet observes, that the <i>prognosticator</i>, made in Paris
many years ago, was a similar preparation.</p>

<p>Although, according to Cadet, this contrivance cannot be
depended upon, as the appearances it presents are not regular;
yet, as the effect is produced by heat, as well as
light and electricity, the following summary may be added:</p>

<p>1. In fair weather, the composition remains at the bottom,
and the liquor is clear.</p>

<p>2. Before rain, it will rise a little; the liquor will be clear,
having merely a star floating in it.</p>

<p>3. Before a storm, it will rise to the surface, the liquor
will appear troubled. These appearances may be seen 24
hours before the change in the weather takes place.</p>

<p>4. In winter, it is higher than common. During a snow,
it will be very white, and pieces are seen in motion.</p>

<p>5. In settled weather in summer, and when warm, the
composition will be low.</p>

<p>6. To know from what quarter wind will come, the composition
will remain attached on the opposite side of the
bottle to that from which it is expected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Camphor has been burnt, like ether and alcohol, by platinum
wire, previously heated. Dr. Ure observes, that a cylinder
of camphor may be used for both wick and spirit, in
the aphlogistic lamp; and the ignition is very bright, while
an odoriferous vapour is exhaled. By adding various essential
oils in small quantities to the alcohol of the lamp, various
<i>aromas</i> may be made to perfume the air of an apartment.
See <a href="#SCEx"><i>Scented Fires for rooms</i>.</a></p>

<p>Camphor is employed in those fire-works chiefly, which
are exhibited in rooms; its expense being an objection to its use
in large exhibitions. In what are termed perfumed pastes, or
mixtures, scented fire, or odoriferous fire-works, it is used in
abundance: in fact, it enters into nearly all the compositions
of this kind. Camphor, besides producing, alone, a white
flame, gives a brilliant light, and, when mixed with other
substances, adds greatly to the appearance of the flame; and,
giving out a powerful odour, destroys, in a measure, the disagreeable
smell arising from the combustion of the sulphur
and nitre.</p>

<p>By referring to the article on Greek fire, and some incendiary
preparations used in war, it will be seen, that camphor
is an important constituent. As camphor is very combustible,
and will even burn on the surface of water, it is well
adapted for all those purposes. We have already spoken of
the Greek fire; and it seems, that the peculiar character of
that fire, of burning in water, was owing to the presence of
camphor. This opinion appears plausible, when we consider,
that some preparations <i>have been</i> made with camphor,
which had the property of burning on water.</p>

<p><a name="CAMx" id="CAMx"></a>Camphor may be pulverized by the assistance of, and
brought into intimate mixture with, nitre and sulphur; because
the former, in particular, tends to divide it. But it may
be pulverized separately, and afterwards added to the composition,
by rubbing it in a mortar with a small quantity of
alcohol, or spirit of wine; or, if this cannot be had, with
fourth proof brandy. As camphor is very inflammable, its
effects, when mixed with saltpetre and fired, are much the
same as those produced by other resins, or concrete oils. A
combustion, more or less rapid, ensues, and, while the nitre
itself is decomposed, the camphor also undergoes the same
change, producing both water and carbonic acid, from the
union of two of its elements, the hydrogen and carbon, with
the oxygen of the nitric acid. In all cases, in which camphor
is employed in artificial fire-works, although its own
flame is <i>white</i>, it may assist in increasing the flame,
which, however, is modified, according to the substances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
which enter into the composition. These may not retard its
combustion, but, nevertheless, may change the appearance of
the flame; as is the case, when we employ the filings of iron,
steel, brass, or zinc, sal ammoniac, rosin, saw-dust, and other
substances, which usually form a part of such mixtures.
Upon the whole, then, we may consider, that camphor acts
in fire-works; 1st, as an inflammable body; 2ndly, that, besides
being in a great measure decomposed, a portion of it
is evaporated, and communicates, to the surrounding atmosphere,
a peculiar smell, which is recognised in the odoriferous
fire-works; 3rdly, that, while it acts in taking a part of
the oxygen from the nitric acid of the nitre, it assists in the
decomposition of this salt, more especially if it be mixed
separately with the nitre; 4thly, that, in all instances of its
combustion, while it acts primarily on the nitre, with the
oxygen of which it forms both water and carbonic acid, it,
at the same time, increases the flame, which may be either
white, red, or yellow, according to the other substances employed;
and, finally, it may be thrown out in the state of combustion,
and receive, for the further support of its combustion,
the oxygen of the air, and hence produce a white exterior
flame, while that in the immediate vicinity of the composition
may be more or less coloured. But its application,
the proportions in which it is used, as well as the kind of fire-works
to which it is applicable, will be considered at large in
other parts of the work.</p>

<p>The great inflammability of camphor is to be ascribed to
its containing a <i>large</i> quantity of carbon and hydrogen, and
a <i>small</i> quantity of oxygen.</p>

<p>There is a preparation, called artificial camphor, that is
formed by passing muriatic acid gas through spirit of turpentine.
It inflames with facility, and burns, without leaving
any residue. Might not this preparation be economically
employed, in lieu of camphor, for incendiary fire-works?</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sect. XVI. Of Gum Benzoin, and Benzoic acid.</i></p>

<p>Gum Benzoin, or Benjamin, is considered a solid balsam,
and is the production of a tree, which grows in Sumatra, &amp;c.
called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">styrax benzoe</i>. It is obtained from this tree by
incision, a tree yielding three or four pounds. It is a brittle
substance, sometimes in the form of yellowish-white tears
and called, from that circumstance, almond benzoin. Besides
a resinous substance, it contains an acid, called the benzoic
or <i>flowers of benzoin</i>, a substance similar to balsam of Peru,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
being a peculiar aromatic principle, soluble in alcohol and
water. By heating it, or by combustion, it evolves a very
agreeable smell, and is, therefore, used in those fire-works
which are exhibited in rooms, theatres, &amp;c. and also in the
composition of odoriferous fire-works. Besides being in itself
inflammable, it produces a peculiar smell, arising, in all
probability, from an essential oil, aided, in some degree, by
the separation of benzoic acid.</p>

<p>It has been examined by Bucholz and Brande. Its general
properties are: that it is insoluble in water, although
hot water takes up a part of it, said to be the benzoic
acid. It is soluble in alcohol, from which it is separated by
muriatic and acetic acids, but not by the alkalies. It is also
soluble in ether.</p>

<p>The benzoic acid, or flowers of benzoin, are obtained from it
by sublimation. A quantity of the powdered gum, put into
an earthen basin, a thick paper cone being tied round the
rim, and heat applied, the acid will leave the resin, and be
condensed on the inner side of the cone. Bucholz (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bulletin
de Pharmacie</cite>, v. p. 177) has given a process for obtaining
it by means of alcohol, and some others have been adopted.
By boiling four ounces of the gum in powder in a sufficient
quantity of water, with three drachms of carbonate of soda,
the acid will unite with the alkali, and form a benzoate of
soda, which, when filtered and decomposed by sulphuric acid,
will yield the benzoic acid. Five drachms of acid will be
thus obtained. Lime has been used in the same manner as
soda, and the acid separated by the addition of muriatic
acid.</p>

<p>Flowers of benzoin may be used in the place of the gum;
using, however, but a small quantity. They will communicate
the same odour to fire as the benzoin. The flowers, or acid
of benzoin, are so inflammable, as to burn, with a clear yellow
flame, without the assistance of a wick. It is soluble in ardent
spirits, in oils, and in melted tallow. The compounds,
which it forms with them, are also inflammable. Benzoic
acid is considered to be an oily acid, and contains, no doubt,
a very large proportion of hydrogen.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sect. XVII. Of Storax Calamite.</i></p>

<p>Storax is the most fragrant of all the balsams. It is afforded
by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">styrax officinalis</i>, a tree which grows in the
Levant. It is sometimes in red tears. Common storax is
in large cakes, and brittle and soft to the touch. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
more fragrant than the other sort, but is frequently adulterated
with saw-dust. It is soluble in alcohol, and is said to
yield some benzoic acid.</p>

<p>Styrax is a different substance; a semi-liquid juice obtained
from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">liquidambar styraciflua</i>. Its odour is less agreeable
than that of storax calamite. It is used in odoriferous fire,
in <i>pastes</i>, in the composition for <i>scented vases</i>, and the like.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sect. XVIII. Of Essential Oils.</i></p>

<p>Essential or volatile oils, as well as the raspings of red
cedar, dried rosemary, and other fragrant plants, are all used
in the preparation of odoriferous fire. In some preparations,
the <i>oil of roses</i> is employed; in others, the essence of bergamot,
of lemon, &amp;c. which, being very volatile, evaporate
in a moderate heat, and, being also inflammable, may assist
in the combustion. In the case of the raspings of cedar in
particular, it also communicates a peculiar appearance to the
flame.</p>

<p>Oils, whether essential or fixed, when passed through ignited
tubes, are decomposed, and furnish an inflammable gas
called olefiant gas. Wax, tallow, &amp;c. produce the same gas,
the hydroguret of carbon. Messrs. Taylor and Martineau
contrived an ingenious apparatus for generating gas from oil
on the great scale, as a substitute for candles, lamps, and coal
gas, it being much preferable for burning, as it contains no
sulphur, and does not injure furniture, books, plate, paint, &amp;c.
Oil gas contains more hydroguret of carbon than coal gas,
which is a great advantage, enabling one cubic foot of oil gas
to go as far as four of coal gas. An elegant apparatus was
erected by Taylor and Martineau at the Apothecaries' Hall,
London, a drawing of which may be seen in the 15th number
of the "<cite>Journal of Science and the Arts</cite>."</p>

<p>It is to be observed, that odoriferous fire-works are intended
for exhibition in close apartments; so that the smell of
certain gases, produced by the nitre, charcoal, and sulphur,
according to the preparation used, will be more or less destroyed.
Such preparations are, nevertheless, expensive, and
for that reason seldom used.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sect. XIX. Of Mastich.</i></p>

<p>This resin, obtained, from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pistacia lentiscus</i>, by making
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'tranverse'">transverse</ins> incisions in the tree, is first in a fluid state, and
gradually concretes into yellowish semi-transparent brittle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
grains. In Turkey, great quantities of it are used for sweetening
the breath, and strengthening the gums. It is from the
use of the resin as a <i>masticatory</i>, that its name is said to be
derived. It is not completely soluble in alcohol, a soft elastic
substance separating from the solution. When exposed to
heat, it melts, and exhales a fragrant odour: for which reason,
principally, it enters into the composition of some fire-works,
as the <i>scented paste</i>. In ordinary fumigations, mastich is
commonly used.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sect. XX. Of Copal.</i></p>

<p>Gum copal, by which name it is known, is a resin, obtained
from a tree, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">thus copallinum</i>. It is often in the
form of a beautiful white resin; but sometimes it is more or less
coloured. It is frequently opaque. It may be dissolved in alcohol,
spirit of turpentine, and oils, by a peculiar management,
(by using camphor, previously melting it, and the like,) and
then it forms the various copal varnishes, which are more or
less perfect, as the copal is transparent, and the solution properly
formed. When heated, it melts like other resins, and
in this, and many other properties, it partakes of the character
of resins in general. It is used in some of the formulæ for
fire-works.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sect. XXI. Of Myrrh.</i></p>

<p>Myrrh is obtained from a plant, supposed to belong to the
genus <i>mimosa</i>, which, as Bruce informs us, (<cite>Travels, &amp;c.</cite>)
grows in Abyssinia and Arabia. It is in the form of tears,
of a reddish-yellow colour; sometimes transparent, and at
other times opaque. It possesses a peculiar odour, and a
bitter and aromatic taste. It burns with difficulty, and does
not melt when heated. With water, it forms a yellow opaque
mixture. It dissolves in alcohol, and the solution is decomposed
by the addition of water, the whole becoming opaque.
According to Braconnot, myrrh is composed of 23 resin,
and 77 gum, in the 100 parts. Pelletier, whose analysis
differs from Braconnot's, observes, that, besides resin, it contains
some volatile oil, to which, no doubt, its fragrance is
owing. The gum, extracted from it, had the character common
to all gums, with the exception, that, instead of forming
the mucous or saclactic acid, by the action of nitric acid, it
produced only oxalic acid.</p>

<p>That myrrh burns with difficulty, is owing entirely to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
presence of so much gum, and, comparatively speaking, the
small quantity of resin, which enters into its composition.
But, notwithstanding this property, as it partakes of a fragrant
oil, it is used in some compositions for fire-works.
The gummy part may retard, as is sometimes required in
particular preparations, the rapidity of the combustion, and
therefore have a two-fold effect when employed in fire-works.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sect. XXII. Of Sugar.</i></p>

<p>Refined sugar is sometimes used in pyrotechno-mixtures.
As it is a vegetable oxide, (composed of carbon, hydrogen,
and oxygen), which is decomposed by heat, and has the property
of decomposing nitric acid, and some of its combinations;
its operation in such mixtures may be readily perceived.
We have seen, when treating of chlorate of potassa,
that, when this salt and sugar are mixed together, and sulphuric
acid poured on the mixture, a rapid combustion ensues,
which is owing as well to the decomposition of the sugar,
as to that of the salt. The matches, likewise, which inflame
by immersion in sulphuric acid, are covered with a similar
mixture. That sugar, therefore, has the property of decomposing
those salts, which are composed of acids, that have
their oxygen but feebly combined, and thereby producing
combustion, according to the temperature employed, or other
agents made use of, is evident from a variety of experiments.
By its action, then, in such cases, the products of combustion,
arising from the elementary parts of the sugar alone,
uniting with oxygen, must be carbonic acid and water. Sugar,
submitted to destructive distillation, affords a variety of
new substances; among which we may notice <i>caromel</i>, or
that peculiar odour, which is recognised in the burning of
sugar. Sugar may, therefore, besides assisting in part in the
decomposition of saline bodies, and particularly nitre, and
perhaps giving rise to new products, with which we are unacquainted,
have another effect, that of destroying the offensive
smell of other substances, by means of the caromel
formed. Sugar, also, when mixed with various bodies, and
struck with a hammer, will produce detonations.</p>

<p>Sugar, when used in compositions of fire, should be pure;
and it may be known to be so, by producing invariably a
phosphorescence in the dark, when two pieces are rubbed
together. At a red heat, it bursts into flame with a kind of
explosion. This flame is white, with blue edges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Sugar is obtained from the sugar-cane; from the sap of the
sugar-maple; from beets and grapes; and from various other
saccharine bodies. It is formed also artificially, by the action
of sulphuric acid on starch.</p>

<p>Mr. Kirchoff, a Russian chemist, accidentally discovered
that starch may be changed into sugar by diluted sulphuric
acid. One hundred parts of starch yield one hundred and ten
of sugar. It appears, that, by the abstraction of a little hydrogen
and carbon, starch will be converted into sugar. Potatoes,
digested with diluted sulphuric acid, Dr. Ure found,
would also form sugar, and very abundantly. The sulphuric
acid may be removed by the addition of chalk, and, as the
sulphate of lime is but slightly soluble, the pure saccharine
fluid may be obtained by filtration. The sugar is procured
in a solid state by evaporation, and may be clarified like other
sugar. Dr. Ure observes, that good beer has been made
from starch-sugar, but recommends potato-sugar. To obtain
the latter, the potatoes are washed, grated down, and treated
with the dilute acid for a day or two, at a temperature of 212°.</p>

<p>The observations of Braconnot are interesting. He has
succeeded in converting a variety of vegetable substances
into gum and sugar. The conversion of wood into sugar,
however remarkable it may seem, has been effected; and
a pound weight of rags will, by the same process, make
more than a pound weight of sugar. Rice, as it contains a
large quantity of fecula, may, we have no doubt, be converted,
in the same manner, into saccharine matter.</p>

<p>When sugar is first obtained, it is impure, containing a variety
of foreign substances, and more or less brown, as the
Muscovado of the West India islands. It is refined, and
formed into loaves, by treating its solution in water with bullocks'
blood, the serum of which coagulates by heat; and, finally,
by pouring the sugar, when sufficiently boiled, into
conical earthen moulds, where it concretes. It is clayed, by
putting a mixture of white clay and water on the sugar in each
of the cones; the water from which passes through, and renders
it beautifully white. The same process may be repeated;
hence the single and double refined sugar. The molasses
passes out from the sugar at the apex of the cone, and is received
in vessels.</p>

<p>From twenty to thirty-five per cent. of molasses are separated
in the refining of raw sugars; and it is supposed, that a
considerable part of it, probably two-thirds, are formed by the
high heat used in the concentration of the sirup. In order
to prevent so great a quantity of molasses, different plans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
have been recommended. That of Howard is highly spoken
of. It consists in surrounding the sugar-boiler with oil
or steam at a high temperature, instead of exposing it, as
heretofore, or the mode usually adopted, to the naked fire.
The boiler is covered at top, and, by means of an air-pump,
the air is exhausted, and the pressure of the atmosphere being
removed, ebullition takes place at a lower temperature.
No blood is used in Mr. H.'s process, instead of which, the
clarification is performed by means of canvass filters, adding
previously a pasty mixture of gypsum and alumina, made by
saturating a solution of alum with quicklime. He does not
employ clay, as is done in whitening the sugar; but, in its
place, makes use of very pure saturated sirup. He uses animal
charcoal, (bone black), which has the property of destroying
vegetable colouring matter. Wilson's process for refining
sugar possesses some advantages. It will be found in
the 34th volume of the <cite>Repertory of Arts</cite>. The patent filtering
apparatus of Sutherland is highly approved.</p>

<p>The chemical properties of sugar are the following: It is
very soluble in water, both hot and cold; it forms with water
a sirup, which on standing will crystallize, forming the candied
sugar. It is not acted upon by oxygen gas. It is capable
of combining with, and, according to some chemists, of neutralizing
acids and alkalies. It is decomposed by nitric acid
with effervescence, being converted into oxalic and malic
acids. Tartaric, acetic, and oxalic acids prevent it from crystallizing.
It unites with lime and strontian, but is partially
decomposed by barytes. It combines also with oxide of lead,
which it precipitates from its solution, forming, as it is called,
a saccharate of lead. Alcohol has some action on it, and
also hydrosulphurets, sulphurets, and phosphurets of alkalies
and alkaline earths. On the application of heat, it melts,
swells, becomes brownish-black, and exhales a peculiar odour,
which we have mentioned, and, at a red heat, takes fire.
Lastly, though possessed of some general and specific characters,
it differs, in some of its properties, according to the
substance from which it is obtained.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sect. XXIII. Of Sal Prunelle.</i></p>

<p>This salt is nothing more than nitrate of potassa, melted in
a crucible, and poured into moulds, whence it receives the
form under which it is found in the shops. The saltpetre,
when merely fused, is not decomposed, as it is when exposed
to a red heat in an iron retort. In the former case, the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
only which it contains is separated; but, in the latter, the
salt itself is decomposed, and oxygen gas evolved. Sal prunelle,
therefore, is fused saltpetre. Combustible bodies, as
charcoal, sulphur, phosphorus, oils, resins, &amp;c. have the same
effect on it as on ordinary nitre. The only advantage it has
over the common refined saltpetre, in the preparation of some
fire-works, is, that it is free from water, and more readily acted
on by combustible substances. In preparing it, care must
be taken in the application of the heat; which, if too powerful,
would, besides fusing it, decompose, and convert it into
nitrite of potassa. It may be readily pulverized and sifted.
For the properties of <i>nitre</i>, see <a href="#NITz">that article.</a></p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="ALCx" id="ALCx"></a><i>Sect. XXIV. Of Alcohol.</i></p>

<p>Alcohol, or rectified spirit of wine, is used for a variety of
purposes in pyrotechny, and, when it cannot be procured,
strong brandy is substituted. In assisting the pulverization
of some substances, as camphor, in forming the mixture of
certain pastes, and in acting as a vehicle for the intimate union
of some bodies, it is considered a necessary article. Alcohol
may be made to form variously coloured flames, by
mixing with it certain saline substances. Thus, boracic
acid will form a green flame; muriate of strontian, a carmine
red; muriate of lime, an orange; nitrate of copper, an emerald
green; nitre, common salt, and corrosive sublimate, a yellow,
&amp;c. As alcohol has the property of dissolving essential oils,
camphor, &amp;c. it may be used as a menstruum for certain oils
in the preparation of odoriferous fire-works. See <i>Articles
on coloured flame, and <a href="#ODOx">odoriferous fire</a></i>.</p>

<p>Alcohol constitutes a part of all ardent spirits, wine, cider,
beer, &amp;c. in which it is combined with water, or with water
and mucilaginous and colouring matter. It is formed in the
vinous fermentation, and always results from the union of
carbon and hydrogen. During the process, carbonic acid gas
is liberated. Fermented liquors, therefore, or those which have
passed through the vinous fermentation, always contain alcohol
in more or less abundance, but mixed with water in many
instances. In some it is accompanied with water, and saccharine,
mucilaginous, and extractive matter. The different
kinds of beer is an example of this fact. When liquors,
which contain spirit, are submitted to distillation, the product
is alcohol and water; for the volatile parts evaporate,
and the fixed substances remain in the still. The spirit partakes,
more or less, of a peculiar taste and flavour, by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
liquors are distinguished from each other. On this subject,
however, it will be sufficient to add, that brandy is procured
by the distillation of wine; rum, from the fermented juice of
the sugar-cane; gin, from fermented grain and juniper-berry;
whiskey, from the fermented mash of grain, cider, &amp;c. and,
generally, the ardent liquors, from pears, peaches, and other
substances, by the same process.</p>

<p>Alcohol, therefore, exists in all these distilled liquors, in a
greater or smaller quantity, combined with water; and the
proportion it bears to the water is known by a standard, as
either proof, above proof, or under proof, according as its
strength is shown by the hydrometer.</p>

<p>The process of obtaining alcohol in a pure state, (usually
called rectified spirit of wine), by which the water is separated
from the alcohol, consists in repeated distillations, either
alone, or mixed with certain substances, which have the property
of uniting with, and keeping down the water, in the
act of distillation. These substances are usually potash, and
dry muriate of lime, both of which substances have a great
affinity for water. The specific gravity of highly concentrated
alcohol, at 60° is .820, but that of common alcohol,
only .837, at the same temperature.</p>

<p>The properties of alcohol are the following: It is a transparent
liquor of an agreeable flavour, and may be changed in
this particular, by essential oils. It may be exposed to a
low temperature without freezing. It boils at 106°, when of
the specific gravity .820, and in a vacuum at 56°. It has a
strong affinity for water, with which it combines in any proportion;
and the specific gravity varies according to the proportion
of the mixture and the temperature, on which are
founded the tables of Blagden, Gilpin, and others.</p>

<p>Neither common air, nor oxygen, has any action on alcohol
at moderate temperatures, whether in a liquid or aeriform
state. On hydrogen, carbon, and charcoal, it has little or no
action, but on phosphorus it acts, a portion of which it dissolves.
With sulphur, it may be made to unite, as also with
the alkalies, but not with the earths, except strontian and
barytes. It is decomposed by sulphuric and nitric acids, with
both of which it forms ether. It dissolves some salts, and
has scarcely any effect upon others. Lastly, it dissolves resins
and essential oils; but it neither acts upon gums, properly so
called, nor on fixed oils. It is a compound of hydrogen,
carbon, and a small proportion of oxygen, and may be decomposed,
by passing its vapour through an ignited porcelain
tube.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Alcohol, by its combustion, as it is used in spirit-lamps
for chemical and other purposes, produces no smoke, in consequence
of the carbon it contains being totally converted,
during that process, into carbonic acid; and its hydrogen,
uniting with another portion of the oxygen of the atmospheric
air, passes off in the form of aqueous vapour. Alcohol,
used in this way, is preferable to oil; for the latter produces
a large quantity of smoke, unless it is burnt in the Argand
lamp. Alcohol is inflamed, when it is brought in contact
with an ignited body. The combustion is rapid without any
residue, and the flame white.</p>

<p>As to the strength of alcohol, the best means of determining
it, is with the hydrometer; but usually its <i>proof</i> is ascertained
by means of gunpowder. A portion of powder, put
into a cup, and alcohol poured on it and inflamed, will, if the
latter be strong, be set on fire; if, however, the powder should
not take fire, but the flame of the alcohol be extinguished, we
infer the existence of water, and that the alcohol is not of the
proper strength. This experiment is founded on this circumstance,
that, if the alcohol contains water, after the alcoholic
portion is all consumed, the water will not only extinguish the
flame, but also prevent the inflammation of the powder. The
hydrometer, however, is the best experiment, as it determines
at once the fact of the <i>strength</i> of the liquor.</p>

<p>Alcohol is used in the preparation of certain fulminating
substances, as fulminating mercury and silver in particular;
the preparation of which, we will give in the two next sections.</p>

<p><a name="FLAx" id="FLAx"></a>
It may not be improper to mention another application of
alcohol, that of forming the <i>aphlogistic lamp</i>, or lamp that
burns without flame. The following description of it, is
given by Accum, in his <cite>Chemical Amusements</cite>, Am. Ed.
p. 355. "In a common lamp, with a wick of about half a dozen
common threads of cotton wick, used for lamps, put some
good spirit of wine. Dispose the threads of wick, not intertwined,
but straight and parallel to each other. Take platina
wire of the thickness of <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub></span>th part of an inch; coil it round
the wick, about nine coils below, and six coils standing above
the top of the wick; the diameter or width of the coils should
not be more than <span class="xs"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>20</sub></span>th, or <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>7</sub></span>th of an inch wide. Light the
wick; and, when the coil of platina above the wick is red-hot,
blow out the flame. There will then be a current of pure
alcohol, gradually rising from the reservoir below, through
the wick, sufficient to keep the upper coil of platina red-hot,
until the whole of the alcohol is consumed. This lamp has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
kept constantly lighted during sixty hours. By means of it,
a match, a bit of spunk, or candle may be lighted when
wanted. The quantity of alcohol consumed is not much:
about an ounce, or an ounce and a half during the night, from
bed-time until morning will suffice." This article was added
to Accum by Dr. Cooper. A figure of the lamp is in Brande's
Chemistry. Dr. Comstock has a paper on the aphlogistic
or flameless lamp, in Vol. IV. p. 328, of Silliman's <cite>Journal
of Science and Arts</cite>, which contains some judicious and useful
remarks. Sir H. Davy (<cite>Journal of the Royal Institution</cite>)
has discovered, that the vapour of camphor answers the
same purpose as alcohol. If a platinum wire be heated and
laid upon camphor, it will continue to glow as long as any
remains, and the wire will frequently light it up into flame.
Davy found, that, in the slow combustion of alcohol, &amp;c. an
acid was generated, to which he gave the name of Lampic
acid. Faraday and Daniel (<cite>Journal of Science and the Arts</cite>)
have confirmed his conclusions.</p>

<p>Dr. Marcet has proposed a method of producing an intense
heat, by causing a current of oxygen gas to pass through the
flame of alcohol. The construction of the lamp and gas-holder
may be found in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives des Découvertes</cite>, Vol. vii,

<p class="centerx"><a name="FULx" id="FULx"></a><i>Sect. XXV. Of Fulminating Mercury.</i></p>

<p>As the fulminating mercury of Howard consists principally
of the oxalate of mercury, the oxalate of this metal may be
employed for the same purpose. Oxalic acid does not act on
mercury, but dissolves its oxide, and forms with it a white
powder. I formed various fulminating metallic powders,
(<cite>See Coxe's Medical Museum</cite>), and prepared one in particular
by merely digesting a solution of the salt of sorrel (superoxalate
of potassa) on red precipitate. The effect is that the
oxalic acid unites with the oxide of mercury, and forms an
oxalate of mercury, which, when struck with a hammer, produces
a detonation. Oxalate of mercury, possessing the same
effects, may be formed, very expeditiously, by pouring the
oxalate, or the superoxalate of potassa into a solution of
nitrate of mercury. The oxalate of mercury will be precipitated,
which is to be caught on a filter, washed, and dried in
a gentle heat.</p>

<p>Howard's fulminating mercury is less dangerous than either
fulminating silver, or fulminating gold. The extreme force
of detonation which it possesses is remarkable. The tem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>perature
required for its explosion is 360 degrees. Friction,
percussion, electricity, and the flint and steel will produce this
effect. It gives rise to a stunning disagreeable report, and its
force is sufficient to indent both the hammer and the anvil.
Four or six grains are sufficient for an experiment. It is
rather singular, as Mr. Cruikshank first observed, that this
powder will not inflame gunpowder; as may be shown by
spreading some of the former on paper, and shaking gunpowder
over it, and then firing the mercurial powder. The
grains of the gunpowder may be collected entire after the
explosion.</p>

<p>From the experiments of Howard, it appears, that this
powder is composed of oxalate of mercury, and nitrous etherised
gas. Fourcroy, however, has shown, that it varies in
its nature, according to the mode of its preparation.</p>

<p>There is also a preparation of mercury, which is likewise
explosive, discovered by Fourcroy. This compound may be
formed by digesting the red oxide of mercury in liquid ammonia
for the space of eight or ten days. The oxide assumes
a white colour, and at last appears in crystalline scales. Upon
ignited coals, it detonates loudly like fulminating gold, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'which see.'">which
see below.</ins> In a few days, however, it loses its fulminating property,
and undergoes spontaneous decomposition. Exposed
to a low heat, the ammonia is disengaged, and an oxide of
mercury remains.</p>

<p>As ammonia forms several detonating compounds with metallic
oxides, the theory of their explosive effects is the same;
viz. that, while the hydrogen of the ammonia unites with the
oxygen of the oxide, forming water, the azote is disengaged
in the state of gas.</p>

<p>The process for preparing Howard's fulminating mercury
is the following, dissolve one hundred grains of mercury in an
ounce and a half (by measure) of common nitric acid, assisting
the solution by heat. When cold, pour the solution upon
two ounces (by measure) of strong alcohol, and apply a moderate
heat, until the mixture begins to effervesce. A white
fume then begins to undulate on the surface of the liquor, and
a white powder precipitates, which is the fulminating mercury.
This powder is to be immediately washed with cold
water, and dried at a heat, not much exceeding that of boiling
water. One hundred grains of mercury, will give, on an
average, one hundred and twenty-five grains of the powder.</p>

<p>The products of its combustion are carbonic acid gas,
azotic gas, water, and mercury. Besides by percussion, it is
inflammable when brought in contact with sulphuric acid. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
is supposed, that fulminating mercury sometimes contains
ammonia, and that the products of combustion, according to
the mode of preparation, are therefore different. The reader
may consult some interesting observations on this powder in
the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de l'Ecole Polytechnique</cite>.</p>

<p>M. Bayen, an apothecary, in 1779, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de Physique</cite>),
announced a process for preparing fulminating mercury. His
process, however, is different from that described. A solution
of mercury is made in nitric acid, and precipitated by
caustic alkali. The precipitate (oxide of mercury) is then
caught on a filter, washed, and dried. Thirty grains of this
powder, mixed with four or five grains of sulphur, and struck
with a heavy hammer, or heated on an iron, will explode
with violence. The oxide of mercury, obtained from its
solution by lime-water, has the same effect, when treated in
the same manner. Another process recommended is, to precipitate
a solution of the perchloride of mercury (corrosive
sublimate) by lime-water, and treat the precipitate with sulphur,
as above described.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sect. XXVI. Of Fulminating Silver.</i></p>

<p>This compound, which is more powerful than fulminating
mercury, is prepared also with alcohol. Descostils (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales
de Chimie</cite>, <span class="xs">LXII.</span> p. 198,) Cruikshank, and Brugnatelli, have
all written upon it.</p>

<p>Fulminating silver explodes without much heat. By the
slightest friction it is inflamed, and detonation follows.
Hence it is used in the form of toys, in fulminating balls, bombs,
crackers, &amp;c. which explode by falling on the ground. Torpedoes,
pulling crackers, &amp;c. are formed of this powder.
The fulminating balls are made of glass, and contain a grain
or two of fulminating silver, mixed with sand. The same
mixture, put on the ends of two strips of paper, and the ends
pasted, forms the pulling crackers; for the moment they are
pulled asunder, the friction produced sets the fulminating
silver on fire, and causes a detonation.</p>

<p>The same preparation placed on a wafer, and the wafer put
between paper, as in the sealing of a letter, will explode, when
the paper or the wafer is broken. Fulminating bombs are
balls of the size of a hazle nut, containing about three grains
of the fulminating silver. Their explosive effects are said to
be violent. See <a href="#DETx"><i>Detonating Works</i>.</a></p>

<p>This powder, in consequence of its powerful action, is dangerous;
and, as it explodes so readily, it should never be put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
into a phial, nor should it be touched or handled in any way
that can produce friction. Even when made to approach the
flame of a candle, it will explode with extreme violence.</p>

<p>The preparation of Brugnatelli's fulminating silver consists
in reducing 100 grains of nitrate of silver (lunar caustic) to
powder; and, when put into a basin, pouring over it one
ounce of alcohol, and the same quantity of nitric acid. The
mixture will become hot, effervescence will ensue, while the
whole will assume an opaque or milky appearance.</p>

<p>When the gray powder of the nitrate has become white,
and the mixture acquires consistency, distilled water is to be
added, to suspend the action. The white precipitate is then
to be washed by repeated affusions of cold water, and dried
in the open air, but in a dark place, so as to seclude it from
the light.</p>

<p>In fact, this process is similar to that for preparing fulminating
mercury; for it is nothing more than treating silver
with nitric acid and alcohol. Cruikshank employs forty
parts of silver, sixty parts of nitric acid, and sixty parts of
alcohol, from which sixty parts of the powder are obtained.</p>

<p>Berthollet considers this powder to be composed of ammonia,
and oxide of silver, and the theory of its detonation to
be the same as that of fulminating gold. In its explosion, the
oxygen of the oxide of silver unites with the hydrogen of the
ammonia, and the nitrogen is disengaged.</p>

<p>Berthollet's fulminating silver, which he discovered in
1788, is another preparation, which fulminates powerfully.
It is prepared by precipitating nitrate of silver by lime-water.
The precipitate is placed on filtering paper, which absorbs the
water, and the nitrate of lime. Pure caustic ammonia is
then added, which produces an effect somewhat similar to
that attending the slaking of lime. The ammonia dissolves
only a part of this precipitate. It is left at rest for ten or
twelve hours, and at the expiration of this time, there is formed,
on the surface, a shining pellicle, which is re-dissolved
with a new portion of ammonia, but which does not appear,
if a sufficient quantity of ammonia has been added at the
first. The liquid is then separated, and the black precipitate,
found at the bottom, is put, in small quantities, on separate
papers. This powder explodes even when moist, if struck
with a hard body. When dry, the slightest friction will explode
it. Its detonation is owing to the same cause as that
producing the explosion of the other preparation of this metal,
as it is also composed of oxide of silver and ammonia.</p>

<p>The fulminating silver of Chenevix explodes only by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
a slight friction in contact with combustible substances. It
is nothing more than chlorate of silver. It is formed by passing
chlorine gas through alumina, diffused in water, and afterwards
digesting, in the liquor, some phosphate of silver.
The whole is to be evaporated slowly. A single grain of this
powder, with three grains of sulphur, will explode by the
slightest friction.</p>

<p>For the preparation of fulminating silver, the formula given
by professor Silliman of Yale College, appears to possess some
advantages. To an ounce of alcohol and as much nitric acid,
he adds 100 grains of pulverized lunar caustic. A gentle heat
is applied to excite the action between them, which must be
removed, the moment they begin to act. When a thick white
precipitate appears, cold water must be added to check the
action. The precipitate is then to be collected, washed, and
carefully dried. A grain or two will explode over a candle.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sect. XXVII. Of Fulminating Gold.</i></p>

<p>The preparation, called by some aurate of ammonia, is
formed by dissolving gold in nitromuriatic acid, diluting the
solution with water, and adding gradually liquid ammonia,
until the precipitation ceases. The precipitate is then to be
caught on a filter, well washed with water, and dried in the
air. The fulminating gold, thus produced, exceeds the
weight of the original gold employed by thirty-three per cent.</p>

<p>Three or four grains of this powder, heated on a knife, will
explode with a loud report. The temperature required for
its explosion is between 230° and 300°. Ten or twelve
grains will penetrate a copper-plate, of the thickness of a
playing card. The facility with which this powder explodes,
is increased by drying. If it be heated until it becomes
black, the slightest touch will cause a detonation. This powder
is composed of oxide of gold, ammonia, and a portion of
chlorine; and, during its detonation, water, nitrogen and chlorine
are evolved, the gold being revived.</p>

<p>The presence of ammonia is necessary to give to gold the
property of fulminating. Fulminating gold accordingly loses
this property, the moment the ammonia is separated. Concentrated
sulphuric acid, melted sulphur, fat oils, and ether
have this effect.</p>

<p>The discoverer of fulminating gold was a German Benedictine
Monk, who lived about the year 1413. Basil Valentine
has described the preparation of it very accurately. He re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>commends,
however, mixing sal ammoniac with aqua fortis,
the old mode of making aqua regia, and distilling the mixture;
then putting in the gold in leaf. After the acid is saturated,
he adds <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oleum tartari</i>, or <i>sal tartari</i> (carbonate of potassa)
dissolved in water; and the precipitated <i>calx</i>, thus obtained,
when collected, washed, and dried in the open air, will
fulminate. In this process, it is evident, that the aqua regia,
prepared with sal ammoniac, contains ammonia, and, when the
gold is dissolved, and the potash added, the oxide of gold
separates, and, from the composition of the powder, must
combine with a portion of ammonia, and hence produce fulminating
gold. He remarks, that distilled vinegar digested
on fulminating gold, destroys its fulminating properties, and
observes also, that care must be taken to prevent its explosion.
He also knew that sulphur would have the same effect.</p>

<p>Bergman (<cite>Treatise on Pulvis Fulminans</cite>) describes the
process employed by Valentine; and Beckman (<cite>History of
Inventions</cite>, v. iii. p. 132,) observes, that, after the time of
Valentine, Crollius, who lived in the last half of the 16th century,
was well acquainted with fulminating gold, and made
its preparation more generally known.  In the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oswaldi
Crollii Basilica Chymica</cite>, 4to, p. 211, published at Frankfort,
in 1609, the process is also to be found. He calls it
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aurum volatile</i>, and speaks of its being useful in medicine.
Beguin, however, appears to have given it the appellation of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aurum fulminans</i>, if we judge from his <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tyrocinium
Chymicum</cite>, 12mo, printed in 1608.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="FULz" id="FULz"></a><i>Sect. XXVIII. Of Fulminating Platinum.</i></p>

<p>While noticing explosive compounds, it may not be improper
to mention that of platinum, lately discovered by Mr.
E. Davy. It explodes, when heated to 400 degrees, with a
sharp report, similar to that produced by fulminating gold;
but neither friction nor percussion will decompose it. It is
formed by making a solution of platinum in nitromuriatic
acid, and passing through it, sulphuretted hydrogen gas,
until no further precipitation ensues. This precipitate, when
collected, and digested in nitric acid, is converted into sulphate
of platinum. This is dissolved in water, and liquid
ammonia then added. The precipitate, now formed, is washed,
and boiled in a solution of potassa, and, after having freed
it from the adhering potassa, is suffered to dry. All fulminating
ammoniacal compounds are analogous; and fulminating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
platinum, being composed of oxide of platinum, ammonia, and
water, is decomposed in the same manner as these compounds.</p>

<p>Fulminating platinum is composed as follows:</p>

<p class="centerx"><a name="DETz" id="DETz"></a><i>Sect. XXIX. Of Detonating Powder from Indigo.</i></p>

<p>That indigo produces a detonating powder by treating it
with nitric acid, is evident from experiment. As it produces
a <i>purple</i> light, it might, perhaps, be used advantageously in
small fire-works.</p>

<p>The process described by Dr. Thomson, (<cite>System of Chemistry</cite>,
<span class="xs">VOL. IV.</span> p. 80, <cite>Amer. edit.</cite>) is to boil one part of indigo
in four parts of nitric acid. The solution will become
yellow, and a resinous matter appear upon its surface. The
boiling is to be stopt, and the liquor cooled. The resinous matter
is then to be separated; and the solution evaporated to the
consistence of honey. This is to be re-dissolved in hot water,
and filtered, and a solution of potassa added, which will
throw down yellow spicular crystals, consisting of <i>bitter
principle</i>, combined with potassa. When the resin is again
treated with nitric acid, the same bitter principle is produced.
The spicular crystals, when wrapped up in paper, and
struck with a hammer, detonate with a purple light.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sect. XXX.  Of the Fulminating Compound, called
Iodide of Azote.</i></p>

<p>Iodine is a particular substance, which has the property not
only of combining with oxygen and hydrogen, forming iodic
and hydriodic acid, but also with various bases constituting a
class of bodies, called iodides. Its union with azote produces
a singular substance, which detonates with great violence,
when slightly touched or heated. It may be formed, by putting
a quantity of iodine into the water of ammonia. It will
be gradually converted into a brownish-black matter, which
is the iodide of azote. It is formed in this process by the
iodine, in the first instance, decomposing a part of the ammonia;
the hydrogen of which combines with a portion of
the iodine, and produces hydriodic acid, which then unites
with the undecomposed part of the ammonia, and forms the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
hydriodate of ammonia; whilst the azote the other constituent
of the ammonia, unites with another portion of the
iodine, and forms the compound in question.</p>

<p>When exposed to the air, iodide of azote gradually flies off
in vapour, without leaving any residue. The products of its
detonation are iodine and azotic gas.</p>

<p>The iodide of azote was discovered by M. Courtois, and
subsequently examined by M. Colin. Iodine, brought in
contact with ammoniacal gas, a combination taking place, produces
a viscid shining liquid of a brownish-black colour,
which, as the saturation goes on, loses its lustre.</p>

<p>This liquid does not detonate, and is considered to be an
iodide of ammonia; but, when it is added to water, it is decomposed,
as well as the water, and we obtain two new compounds,
as before observed, the hydriodate of ammonia, and
iodide of azote. This iodide detonates. Hence it is evident,
that hydrogen united with azote, in ammonia, prevents explosion;
for the moment it is taken away, by the formation of
hydriodic acid, and the azote itself combines with the iodine,
a fulminating compound is formed. The elements of this
powder are feebly united.</p>

<p>It is found, that hydriodate of ammonia has the property of
dissolving a large quantity of iodine, and, if suffered to remain
with the iodide of azote, of decomposing it also, and
setting the azote at liberty. Water is said to have the same
effect, although feebly.</p>

<p>Iodate of potassa, a salt composed of iodic acid and potassa,
when mixed with sulphur, and struck with a hammer, will
detonate, in consequence of the decomposition of the iodic
acid. The iodate of potassa may be formed very readily by
agitating iodine with a solution of caustic potassa. The water
is decomposed, and the hydriodate of potassa is also formed,
which, being very soluble, remains in solution, whilst the
iodate separates, on concentrating the liquor, and suffering it
to stand.</p>

<p>Chlorate, as well as nitrate of silver, form with sulphur
fulminating powders.</p>

<p>Iodic acid, called also oxy-iodine, (prepared by exposing
iodine to the action of euchlorine,) when heated in contact
with inflammable substances, and the more combustible metals,
will produce detonations.</p>

<p>It appears, however, that sulphur has a stronger affinity for
oxygen than iodine has, and iodine a stronger affinity than
chlorine for the same element. Hence chloric acid is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
readily decomposed by inflammable bodies than iodic acid,
and iodic acid, sooner than sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>The acids, which chlorine, iodine, and sulphur form respectively
with oxygen, Gay-Lussac remarks, have their
elements more strongly <i>condensed</i>, than the same substances
united with hydrogen.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="DETy" id="DETy"></a><i>Sect. XXXI. Of Detonating Oil, or Chloride of Azote.</i></p>

<p>This oil is produced by the action of chlorine on ammonia,
by using some of the salts of this alkali. A small jar of chlorine
gas is transferred into a basin, containing a solution of
nitrate or muriate of ammonia, a little heated: an absorption
will gradually take place, and the gas be condensed. An <i>oily
film</i> will now appear on the surface of the ammoniacal solution,
which, as it increases, will form globules and fall through
the liquor. This substance is the detonating oil, composed,
according to analysis, of chlorine, azote, and hydrogen. It is
supposed by Messrs. Wilson, Porret, and Kirk, that the
hydrogen serves as a medium of union between the chlorine
and azote, and that, in detonation, the powerful effect is owing
to the chlorine.</p>

<p>Detonating oil explodes violently at 212 degrees; and even
when touched with cold inflammable substances, as a portion
of olive oil, about the size of a pin's head, the detonation is
also violent, and the vessel, in which the experiment is made,
will, in most cases, be broken into fragments.</p>

<p>Detonating oil is considered, however, a chloride of azote.
In order to prevent the decomposition of the chloride by the
ammoniacal salt, a thin stratum of muriate of soda, put into
the bottom of the vessel, is recommended. Its specific gravity
is 1.653. Warm water, put into a vessel containing it,
will change it to an aeriform fluid of an orange colour. "I
attempted," says Sir H. Davy, "to collect the products of
the new substances, by applying the heat of a spirit-lamp to a
globule of it, confined in a curved glass tube over water: a
little gas was at first extricated; but, long before the water had
attained the temperature of ebullition, a violent flash of light
was perceived, with a sharp report; the tube and glass were
broken into small fragments, and I received a severe wound
in the transparent cornea of the eye, which has produced a
considerable inflammation of the eye, and obliges me to make
this communication by an amanuensis. This experiment
proves what <i>extreme</i> caution is necessary in operating on this
substance; for the quantity I used was scarcely as large as a
grain of mustard seed." <cite>Phil. Trans.</cite> 1813, Part I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>In <i>vacuo</i>, it expands into vapour, which still possesses the
power of exploding by heat. In water, it gradually disappears,
the water becoming acid, and azote being evolved.
Mercury decomposes it, and a white powder (calomel) is
formed, while the azote is set at liberty.</p>

<p>Dr. Ure (<cite>Chemical Dictionary</cite>, Art. <i>Nitrogen</i>,) observes,
that the mechanical force of this compound, seems superior to
that of any other known substance, not even excepting the
ammoniacal fulminating silver. The velocity of its action
appears to be likewise greater.</p>

<p>The Doctor touched a minute globule of it, in a platina
spoon, resting on a table, with a fragment of phosphorus at
the point of a pen-knife, and the blade was instantly shivered
into fragments by the explosion.</p>

<p>Messrs. Porret, Wilson, and Kirk (<cite>Nicholson's Journal</cite>,
Vol. XXXIV,) employed 125 different substances, by bringing
them in contact; and out of that number the following
caused it to explode:</p>

<p class="centerx"><a name="PYRx" id="PYRx"></a><i>Sect. XXXII. Of Pyrophorus.</i></p>

<p>Pyrophorus is a black substance, which takes fire spontaneously,
when brought into contact with air.  It is the
luft-zunder, or air-tinder of the Germans.  It first emits sulphuretted
hydrogen gas, and in a few seconds becomes red-hot,
burning with a bluish flame.  Pyrophorus consists of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
alumina, charcoal, and sulphuret of potassa, and also, according
to some, of potassium, which is alleged to be formed in
its preparation. Be this as it may, it seems, that water is
decomposed in its combustion, that sulphuretted hydrogen
gas is emitted, which is inflamed by the oxygen gas of the
atmosphere, and that, during the combination of oxygen, a
degree of heat is produced, which causes the ignition of
the charcoal, as well as the inflammation of the remaining
sulphur.</p>

<p>Pyrophorus may be formed in several ways, all of which
produce the same result. The usual process is the following:
Take equal parts of brown sugar and alum, and melt them in
a ladle. Continue the heat, stirring them constantly until a
spongy black mass is formed. Let this mass be reduced at
once to powder, and introduced into a common green glass
phial, of the capacity of about six ounces, previously coated
outside with a mixture of pipe-clay and solution of borax.
Immerse the phial in a crucible, filled with sand, closing the
mouth of the former with a piece of charcoal, or a glass tube
inserted in it. Upon the crucible being exposed to a red heat,
an inflammable gas will escape, which will take fire.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> When
this effect ensues, the heat must be continued for about twenty
minutes longer, at the expiration of which time, the crucible
must be removed from the fire, and the phial taken out
and closely stopt. The pyrophorus is to be preserved in a
ground stoppered bottle. The addition of one-sixteenth part
of sulphate of soda, or Glauber's salt, to the alum and sugar,
is said to make the pyrophorus with more certainty. Various
vegetable substances, besides sugar, as flour, starch, &amp;c.
may be used. Three parts of alum, and one part of wheat
flour will make a good pyrophorus.</p>

<p>Homberg discovered this substance, in the year 1680.
Hence it is sometimes called Homberg's pyrophorus. He
was operating upon a mixture of human excrement and
alum; and, when he examined the contents of his vessel, in
three or four days after, he was surprised to see it take fire
spontaneously, when brought to the air. Soon after Lemery,
the younger, discovered, that honey, sugar, flour, or almost
any animal or vegetable matter, could be used in lieu of human
fæces; and, as Macquer informs us, M. Lejoy de Suvigny
showed, that other salts, containing sulphuric acid, may
be substituted for alum. Mr. Scheele (<cite>Treatise on fire</cite>, &amp;c.)
found by experiment, that, when alum was deprived of potassa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
it was incapable of forming pyrophorus, and that vitriolated
tartar (sulphate of potassa) may be used in the place of
alum. The experiments of Mr. Proust prove, that a number
of neutral salts, composed of vegetable acids and earths, when
submitted to heat, leave a residuum that inflames spontaneously.
This statement agrees with the experiments of M. Chenevix.
From the experiments and observations of sir H.
Davy, and Dr. J. R. Coxe, late professor of chemistry, but
now of materia medica, &amp;c. in the University of Pennsylvania,
it is rendered very probable, that pyrophorus owes its
property of inflaming spontaneously to a small portion of potassium,
which is formed in the process.</p>

<p>The preparation of pyrophorus is explained on the principle,
that the vegetable matter is first decomposed; that the
hydrogen and a part of the carbon decompose the sulphuric
acid of the alum, by uniting with its oxygen; that water, carbonic
oxide, and carburetted hydrogen are disengaged, along
with a part of the sulphur; and that, while the excess of charcoal
remains intimately mixed or divided with the alumina,
the sulphur and the sulphuret of potassa, form together a
compound, which has the property of inflaming spontaneously
in the open air. Some suppose, as alum is a triple salt, having
potassa, as well as alumina, for its base, that the potassa is decomposed
in the process, and potassium, as we remarked,
produced; to the presence of which they ascribe the singular
property of inflaming in the open air.</p>

<p>The spontaneous combustion of charcoal, in several instances,
is supposed by some to have been owing to the presence
of pyrophorus, by others to phosphorus, and by others again
to nascent hydrogen. To the presence of this substance, is
attributed the explosion of gunpowder mills. (See <a href="#GUNx"><i>Gunpowder</i>.</a>)</p>

<p>Several different mixtures, and torrefied substances, form a
kind of imperfect pyrophori, and have more than once occasioned
fires, from no suspicion of their properties being entertained.</p>

<p>Besides pyrophorus, other compositions, which, in like
manner, take fire on exposure to the open air, have been by
degrees made known to us: 1. The scoria of the martial regulus
of antimony, or antimony freed from sulphur by the intervention
of iron and nitre, as well crude as also after being
dissolved, have been observed to take fire spontaneously,
when laid upon a hot stone, or in the sun. Of the truth of
the latter case, Wiegleb says, he is assured by his own experience.
2. The residuum of the acetate of copper is another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
pyrophorus. 3. Some assert, that they have observed an inflammation
ensue from honey and flour, calcined according to
the rules laid down. 4. According to Geoffroy, a calcined
mass of three parts of black soap, and one of diaphoretic antimony,
has been known to take fire spontaneously. 5. Meuder
has observed, that a pyrophorus is obtained, when equal
parts of orpiment and iron-filings are sublimed together, and
ten parts of this sublimate are triturated in a mortar along with
twelve of nitrate of silver. 6. A pyrophorus is produced,
according to Penzky, when two drachms of white sand, three
of common salt, one of sulphur, two of sulphuric acid, and
half an ounce of muriatic, are mixed together and distilled in
a glass retort. In this operation, a sublimate is said to be
obtained, which bursts out in flames, as soon as it comes into
contact with the air. 7. The spontaneous precipitate of osteocolla,
from a solution of it in sulphuric acid, after having been
separated by means of a filter, and dried, took fire in a warm
place. S. Pott observed the same phenomenon in the earth of
the residuum, after the distillation of urine, that had been
putrid for a considerable time. 9. To these may also be referred,
a mass composed of equal parts of sulphur and iron-filings;
which, when thoroughly moistened with water, after
some time, grows hot, swells, and at last breaks out into vapour,
smoke, and flame. (See <a href="#ARVx"><i>Artificial Volcano</i>.</a>)</p>

<p>Cadet's fuming liquor, prepared by distilling equal parts
of acetate of potassa, and arsenious acid, emits a very dense,
heavy, fetid, noxious vapour, which inflames spontaneously
in the open air. Black wadd, an ore of manganese, when
dried by the fire, and mixed with linseed oil, gradually becomes
hot, swells, and then bursts into flame.</p>

<p>M. Chenevix (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales de Chimie</cite>, tom. <span class="xs">LXIX</span>,) remarks
that almost all the metallic residuums, which are formed by
the distillation of acetates <i>per se</i>, are pyrophoric, after cooling;
which Mr. C. attributes to the presence of finely divided
charcoal, mixed with the metallic part. He experimented
on several acetates, with the view of ascertaining the quantity
of pyroacetic spirit they would yield, and found, in every
instance, that charcoal existed in the residue, sometimes with
reduced metal, and at other times with metallic oxide. A
table of these experiments may be seen in Ure's <cite>Chemical
Dictionary</cite>. The residuum of acetate of copper has long
been known to possess pyrophoric properties.</p>

<p class="centerx"><a name="SALx" id="SALx"></a><i>Sect. XXXIII. Of Sal Ammoniac.</i></p>

<p>This salt enters into the composition of fire-works, to give,
more particularly, a peculiar colour to flame, which is that of
green, or yellowish-green. Sal ammoniac is a salt, composed
of muriatic acid and ammonia, and, when pure, is white, and
capable of being sublimed without decomposition. Its purity
may be known by its complete volatilization. It is readily
pulverized.</p>

<p>The experiment, showing the formation of sal ammoniac
by a direct union of its component parts, may be made by
bringing in contact, in a glass receiver, muriatic acid gas and
ammoniacal gas. White clouds will form, a condensation
take place, and muriate of ammonia be deposited on the sides
of the vessel.</p>

<p>Sal ammoniac was altogether made, at one period, from the
soot of camels' dung, or of other animals, which feed on
saline plants. The excrement was burnt, the soot collected,
and sublimed. This was the process practised in Egypt.
The composition of sal ammoniac being known, the process
for obtaining it was improved; so that, instead of using the
soot of dung, it is now formed by the distillation of bones.
The impure ammoniacal liquor, thus obtained, is combined
with sulphuric acid, by an easy process, and the resulting
sulphate of ammonia is then decomposed by muriate of soda,
by which sulphate of soda and muriate of ammonia are produced.
They are separated, and the latter is formed into
heads by sublimation. In this state, it occurs in commerce.
It was made in great quantity in the vicinity of the temple
of Jupiter Ammon; and hence its name.</p>

<p>Mr. Minish, according to the English writers, is entitled
to this method of converting impure liquid ammonia into sal
ammoniac. The following is an outline of his process. He
suffered the impure ammoniacal liquor to percolate through
a stratum of bruised gypsum, and as carbonate of ammonia
is contained in the liquor, the fluid, which filters, would contain
sulphate of ammonia, the carbonate of lime being insoluble.
This sulphate he evaporated, and the dry mass, mixed
with muriate of soda, was sublimed. If I am not greatly
mistaken, however, although I have not the work to refer to,
this process is described in Dr. John Pennington's <cite>Chemical
Essays</cite>, a work published in Philadelphia, about 1792. Dr.
Pennington's work, we may observe, is the first chemical
book which was published in the United States, and contains
numerous important facts and observations. That this pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>cess
was known in Philadelphia, and used at the <i>Globe works</i>,
or rather <i>Glaub works</i>, (from the circumstance that Glauber's
salt was made there,) is within the recollection of many.
I heard the late professor Wistar speak of this process, and of
the economy in using gypsum.</p>

<p>Mr. Lebanc (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales de Chimie</cite>, vol. <span class="xs">XIX</span>.) invented
a process, by which he brought the ammoniacal gas and muriatic
acid gas in contact, in a chamber lined with lead. In
one pot, he put common salt and oil of vitriol; in another pot,
animal matter. Being conducted by pipes into the chamber,
the gases united, and sal ammoniac was formed. Other improvements
have been made, as obtaining ammonia from coal
soot, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Ammonia is generated in artificial nitre beds, and is at first
united with nitric acid; which compound is subsequently decomposed,
as the process of putrefaction goes on, by the potassa,
calcareous earth, &amp;c. present in nitre beds. <i>See <a href="#NITw">Nitrate
of Potassa.</a></i></p>

<p>Sal ammoniac is ready formed in the soot of animal feces,
twenty-six pounds of which yield six of the salt. According
to Siccard, who published, in 1716, an account of the fabrication
of sal ammoniac in Egypt, which Geoffroy, in the
same year, proved to be a compound of the spirit of sea salt
and volatile alkali, sea salt and urine were used in that country.
The account, however, given by Lemery, in 1719,
makes no mention of either sea salt or urine.</p>

<p>Sal ammoniac is found native. It occurs in the vicinity
of burning beds of coal, both in Scotland and England, and
is met with in volcanic countries. When triturated with
quicklime, it exhales ammonia, which is a characteristic of
all ammoniacal salts.</p>

<p>Sal ammoniac is often found in crusts of lava. Sir William
Hamilton observes, that, in the fissures formed by the lava,
this salt sublimes. He found, in the same locality, common
salt.</p>

<p>Sal ammoniac is decomposed by a variety of substances.
Sulphuric acid will disengage the muriatic acid from it, while
lime, potassa, &amp;c. liberates the ammoniacal gas, which, when
combined with water by distillation or other means, forms
the common spirit of sal ammoniac, or water of ammonia.
Mixed with carbonate of lime and sublimed, it produces the
carbonate of ammonia, usually called mild volatile alkali, or
pungent smelling salts. Ammonia, in a separate state, unites
with some metallic oxides, giving rise to certain fulminating
powders, which have been already noticed. That iodine de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>composes
ammonia, we have shown, when on the preparation
of iodide of azote, or fulminating powder.</p>

<p>Sal ammoniac enters into the composition of candles, to
prolong their duration. The process recommended in the
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives des Découvertes</cite> is the following: Dissolve, in
half a pint of water, a quarter of an ounce of sal ammoniac,
two ounces of common salt, and half an ounce of saltpetre,
and add the solution to three pounds of mutton tallow, and
eight pounds of beef tallow, previously melted. Continue
the heat until all the water is evaporated. It is then suffered
to cool, and, when used, is to be melted with a quarter of
an ounce of nitre, and formed into candles in the usual manner.
This preparation of tallow is highly recommended on
account of its economy, as well as the improvement itself.
A candle, made of this tallow, will burn two hours longer
than one of the ordinary kind.</p>

<p>Another process for making candles, in which sal ammoniac
is used, is mentioned in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales des Arts et Manufactures,
Nos. 142 and 146</cite>. Eight pounds of suet are melted,
and a pint of water is added. The tallow is again submitted
to heat, and the same quantity of water, holding in solution
half an ounce of saltpetre, half an ounce of sal ammoniac, and
one ounce of alum, is added. It is then suffered to stand, and
when used is re-melted. The wick is first dipped in a mixture
of camphor and wax. Care must be taken, before the tallow is
used, to evaporate the water. Equal parts of beef and mutton
tallow are recommended.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sect. XXXIV. Of Corrosive Sublimate.</i></p>

<p>Corrosive sublimate, known in chemistry by the names of
corrosive muriate, and perchloride of mercury, is made use
of in some preparations of fire-works, and particularly in the
composition of stars, in which it is mixed with a variety of
substances, such as steel filings and antimony, in order to
vary the appearance of the flame, and to communicate to it
particular colours. Corrosive sublimate is formed by various
processes, among which we may enumerate the following:
Take five parts of sulphuric acid, four parts of mercury, four
parts of muriate of soda, and one part of black oxide of manganese.
Boil the mercury in the sulphuric acid, until it forms
a dry sulphate, which is to be reduced to five parts. Mix the
sulphate thus formed, with the muriate of soda, previously
dried, and the oxide of manganese, and sublime the mixture.
By this process the sulphuric acid of the sulphate unites with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the soda, and forms sulphate of soda; while the muriatic acid
of the muriate of soda combines with the oxide of mercury,
(which receives an addition of oxygen from the oxide of manganese,)
and forms the perchloride, called by Thenard the
deutochloride of mercury. The same process is used without
the addition of manganese. By exposure to heat, the
sublimate sublimes, and the sulphate of soda forms the residuum.
The same salt, if re-sublimed with an addition of crude
mercury, will be changed into the protochloride of mercury,
or calomel. Or, if the sulphate of mercury and muriate of
soda be mixed with crude mercury, and sublimed, calomel
will be formed at one operation. It is sufficient to observe,
that corrosive sublimate is one of the most virulent of poisons
when swallowed; and therefore should be used with caution.</p>

<p>It is soluble in water, and capable of crystallizing. It is
also soluble in alcohol, to the flame of which it communicates
a yellow colour, and in sulphuric, nitric, and muriatic acids.
It is decomposed by alkalies, forming with ammonia a triple
salt, (<i>Sal Alembroth</i>,) by the alkaline earths, and the metals
or their sulphurets; and, when distilled with arsenic,
bismuth, antimony, or tin, the mercury is separated.</p>

<p>The proper antidote for corrosive sublimate, is the white of
egg or albumen, which converts it into calomel. Sulphuretted
hydrogen water may also be employed along with emetics.
The effect of albumen, in this way, may be relied on.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sect. XXXV. Of Orpiment.</i></p>

<p>Orpiment, or the yellow sulphuret of arsenic, which is
either native or artificial, is principally used in fire-works for
the composition of stars. Orpiment is divided by some into
two kinds; viz. the red, called realgar, and the yellow, called
yellow arsenic.</p>

<p>Arsenic combines readily with sulphur. When they are
mixed together, and put into a crucible and fused, the product
will be a red vitreous mass. This red sulphuret may also
be formed, by melting sulphur with arsenious, or arsenic
acid. Sulphurous acid gas will be evolved, evidently showing
that a portion of the sulphur unites with the oxygen of
acid employed.</p>

<p>When arsenious acid, known in commerce by the name of
white arsenic, and called by some oxide of arsenic, is dissolved
in muriatic acid, and a solution of sulphuretted hydrogen
in water is added, a yellow precipitate will be obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
which is orpiment. The hydrogen, in this case, unites with
the oxygen of the arsenious acid, by which the metal is reduced,
and the sulphur then combines with it. A mixture of
sulphur and arsenic, exposed to a heat not sufficient to melt
them, will sublime into a yellow sulphuret.</p>

<p>Both the yellow and red sulphurets are employed in fire-works.
They are not, however, required, except in particular
cases. In the composition of Bengal lights, given in the
Bombardier or Pocket Gunner, by R. W. Adye, orpiment is
used. According to the same author, it is also used in Chinese
white lights. Both the yellow and red sulphuret of arsenic
will detonate with chlorate of potassa.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="ANTx" id="ANTx"></a><i><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'XXXVI.'">Sect. XXXVI.</ins> Of Antimony.</i></p>

<p>The antimony, which enters into the composition of many
fire-works, is not to be understood to be the metallic, or regulus
of, antimony, unless so expressed; but the crude antimony
of the shops. Crude antimony is a combination of
antimony and sulphur, and is usually met with in fine powder.
That both antimony and its sulphuret have a powerful effect
in modifying the flame of gunpowder, and all compositions,
in which nitre and inflammable substances form a part, is evident
from the many cases, in which it is employed, and from
the effects that thereby result.</p>

<p>The different substances in any inflammable compound, intended
to produce particular colours, should be so mixed, as
that, from a knowledge of the proportions which produce
such colours, the <i>effect</i> may be retained, even when it is mixed
with other bodies. For this reason, the artist should know
the different effect of each ingredient. Some may show themselves
in the flame, some in sparks, some in stars, others in
fire-rain, and the like, as the case may be. Antimony, for
instance, produces a reddish flame, if it be in a proper proportion,
and not altered by the presence of other substances.
Hence, when antimony is mixed with nitre, the flame will be
more or less a <i>whitish-green</i>.</p>

<p>This modification, or change in the appearance of flame, is
apparent in certain compounds, of which antimony constitutes
a part. Thus, antimony is used in the preparation of the common
rocket stars, in drove stars, in the fixed pointed stars,
in some of the gold and silver rains, in the slow and dead fire
for wheels, in tourbillons for crowns or globes, in the composition
of serpents, lances for illumination, Bengal lights, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
many other kinds of fire-works. According to Adye, (Pocket
Gunner,) it enters into the composition of carcasses, Chinese
lights, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When it is as one to sixteen of nitre, the gunpowder being
as four, and the sulphur, eight, the composition will produce
a white flame; but when it is in the proportion of eight to
sixteen of nitre, without any addition, the flame will be blue.
By substituting, in its place, eight of amber to sixteen of
nitre, with sixteen of sulphur, and eight of meal powder, this
change will produce a yellow flame. It is obvious, however,
that these and similar changes are owing to the proportions,
as well as to the substances used.</p>

<p>Antimony, in the state of a sulphuret, when mixed with
chlorate of potassa, &amp;c. will form detonating compounds.</p>

<p>Antimony is a grayish-white metal, more or less brilliant
and laminated. It is brittle, and may be easily reduced to
powder. It melts at a red heat, and evaporates at a higher
temperature: on cooling, it crystallizes. It undergoes no
change by exposure to the air, except the loss of its lustre.
When steam is made to pass over ignited antimony, the decomposition
of the water is so rapid, as to produce a violent
detonation. At a white heat, it burns, and forms a white
coloured oxide, called the <i>argentine flowers of antimony</i>.
Its oxides are various, some of which, possessing acid properties,
are called acids. The protoxide is gray, the antimonious
acid, white, and antimonic acid, of a straw colour.
The crocus of antimony, and the glass of antimony are oxides
of this metal, but in particular states of combination.
It unites with several of the acids. Its oxide, with tartaric
acid, and tartrate of potassa, forms <i>tartar emetic</i>. With
chlorine, it constitutes the butter of antimony.</p>

<p>The artificial sulphuret may be formed, by melting sulphur
and antimony together. The native sulphuret is almost
the only ore of antimony, and is the mineral from which
the regulus is obtained. It unites with the metals, forming
alloys of different kinds.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sect. XXXVII. Of Carbonate of Potassa.</i></p>

<p>Potassa, either pure or carbonated, retards the progress
of combustion; and, therefore, may prevent, according to
the proportion employed, the action of combustible bodies on
nitre. Combustion may be retarded by using those substances,
which are not in themselves inflammable, and which,
if used in too large a quantity, would effectually prevent it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Clay, wood ashes, &amp;c. as in the blind fuse, act on this principle;
and serve, also, in particular cases, to produce that
succession of explosions, which renders the effect of some
fire-works, more grand and impressive. Rope, soaked in a
solution of saltpetre and dried, would burn rapidly, were it
not for the after immersion in potash ley, or urine, either of
which acts by retarding the progress of combustion. The
same thing may be said of other bodies, the use of which will
claim our attention hereafter. Potassa, although not generally
used for the purposes mentioned, as it is apt to deliquesce,
or absorb water, and thus destroy the effect altogether, may
be more advantageously employed in a liquid state, as in the
preparation of slow match in the way stated under that head.
But as match rope is now generally superseded by the port-fire,
as a more certain method of firing cannon, it would be
unnecessary, as it is irrelevant, to enlarge on this head. The
use, also, of the priming fuse, which conveys the fire to the
powder in the gun, with certainty and with rapidity, is an
improvement of no small moment.</p>

<p>Alum has also been used for the purpose of checking the
rapidity of combustion, in some particular fire-works. In
one of the formulæ for the preparation of <i>fire-balls</i>, to be
thrown with the hand, or fired from a gun, given in the <cite>Memoir
on Military Fire-works</cite>, as taught at Strasburg, in
1764, there is, besides sulphur, mutton suet, saltpetre, and
antimony, <i>nitre of alum</i>, equal to one-fourth of the weight
of the compound. That this salt, the supersulphate of alumina
and potassa, is used to make paper, as cartridge paper,
&amp;c. incombustible, is a fact, with which every one is acquainted.</p>

<p>We might, also, enumerate the uses of glue, isinglass, gum
arabic, &amp;c. for similar purposes; and also of wood-ashes, in
the composition of the, so called, blind fuse. Light twisted
white rope, when soaked in strong ley, or a strong solution
of potash, we are informed, will form a slow match that will
burn only three feet in six hours.</p>

<p>Potash is obtained from wood-ashes, by lixiviation with
water, and evaporation. It contains more or less impurities;
and always carbonic acid, from which it is separated by quicklime,
the alkali being rendered caustic. Some of the foreign
ingredients are burnt off by exposing it to heat in an oven.
It then assumes a white, somewhat <i>pearly</i> appearance, and
takes the name of pearl-ash, but is still the same alkali.</p>

<p>Wood-ashes, when mixed with quicklime, and lixiviated,
produce caustic ley, the strength of which depends on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
quantity of alkali held in solution. It is this ley, when boiled
with oils, fat, &amp;c. that produces soft soap. Hard soap is
a combination of oil or fat, and soda. The quantity of real
alkali in potash may be known by the proportion of acid required
to saturate a given weight of it. Potash, pearl-ash,
salt of tartar, and salt of wormwood are all carbonates of potassa.
This alkali is called the vegetable alkali, because it is
obtained from vegetables. It is considered to be the hydrated
deutoxide of potassium, and when decomposed will furnish
potassium.</p>

<p class="p1">The observations of Mr. Kirwan on potash may be seen in
<cite>Aikin's Chemical Dictionary</cite>.</p>

<p>When a piece of hydrated potassa is placed between two
disks of platinum, which are brought in contact with the poles of
a galvanic battery, consisting of upwards of 200 pairs of plates,
four inches square, the oxygen will separate at the positive surface,
and small metallic globules of potassium will be formed at
the negative surface. The potassa, in the mean time, will
undergo fusion.</p>

<p>Sir H. Davy discovered potassium, in 1807. It may be
obtained by means of iron turnings, in the following manner:
Heat the iron turnings to whiteness in a curved gun barrel,
and suffer potassa, in a state of fusion, to fall upon them very
gradually, air being excluded: potassium will form, and collect
in the cool part of the tube. For the different facts respecting
this metal, consult Sir H. Davy's communications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
on the subject, and the memoirs of Gay-Lussac and Thenard,
Curadeau, &amp;c. See also, Davy's <cite>Chemical Philosophy</cite>, and
Thenard's <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de Chimie</cite>.</p>

<p>Potassa unites with, and neutralizes, acids, and forms salts;
the principal of which are the sulphate, muriate, and nitrate
of potassa. It unites also with sulphur, phosphorus, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Potassa, in the state of carbonate, is very soluble in water,
for which it has so strong an affinity, that, when exposed to
the atmosphere, it deliquesces and becomes fluid. Caustic
potassa undergoes the same change, in a more remarkable degree.
It is on account of its great avidity for water, that
the carbonate is used in the preparation of alcohol from
spirituous liquors; it retaining the water, while the alcohol
may be distilled over.</p>

<p>Potassa has a stronger affinity for the acids, than either the
earths or metals; hence it decomposes earthy and metallic salts,
the earth or metallic oxide being precipitated, while it unites
with the acid of the salt. It is on the same principle, that earthy
and metallic salts decompose soap; and waters which are hard,
and owe that property to the presence of earthy salts, will
curdle, or, in other words, decompose soap. Such waters,
for this reason, are called hard. Acids have the same effect
in decomposing soap.</p>

<p>The use of potassa is very apparent in the manufacture of
saltpetre. When the nitric acid is combined with an earthy
base, as in the calcareous nitre of the nitre caves of the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'west-tern'">western</ins>
country, potassa from wood-ashes will decompose it, on
the principle already stated; and, by combining with the nitric
acid, form nitrate of potassa. It is used also in refining
saltpetre, where earthy salts are present, besides common
salt. The effect of this alkali, for that purpose, will be more
obvious, by referring to the processes for the extraction and
refining of saltpetre, in the article on that subject.</p>

<p>Potassa acts as a flux for siliceous substances and forms
glass. These are its prominent characters.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sect. XXXVIII. Of Wood-Ashes.</i></p>

<p>Wood-ashes, the product of the combustion of wood, contain
potassa, some foreign salts, and earthy and sometimes
metallic substances, insoluble in water. The quantity of
alkali, which ashes, obtained from different woods, furnish,
is greater or less, according to the nature of the wood. The
ashes of the oak are generally used in pyrotechny; but it
seems to us, that ashes in common will have the same effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>The ashes, for this purpose, should be dry, and passed
through a fine sieve. They enter into the composition of
blind fuse.</p>

<p>In some instances, the <i>leached</i>, or lixiviated ashes might be
used. The residue, after the separation of alkali and saline
matter by the action of water, is nothing more than the insoluble
part of the ashes. Caustic ley is always obtained
from wood-ashes, by mixing them with about a fiftieth part
of quicklime, and putting them into a barrel or tub, and adding
water. The lime takes up the carbonic acid, and the
ley comes off in a caustic state. If the solution should not
contain a sufficient quantity of potassa, or not bear an egg,
as that is the usual criterion of its strength, (which depends
on its specific gravity,) its strength may be increased by evaporation;
and, if too strong, simple dilution with water, is all
that is <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'nesessary'">necessary</ins>.</p>

<p>While the ashes of some plants, as the upland plants, generally
yield potassa; others, as many marine plants, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">salicornia
europea</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">salsola tragus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">salsola kali</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> afford soda
by incineration. It will be sufficient, however, to observe,
that the ashes of all plants contain alkali, in more or less
quantity, which depends on various circumstances; and that
the alkali may be extracted by lixiviation, and, in some instances,
may even be seen among the ashes, in a semivitrified
mass. The white ashes, which are formed by the combustion
of animal matter, as osseous or bony substances, we
may remark, do not afford potassa or soda, but only phosphate
of lime, and some uncombined earths. Bones, nevertheless,
may, like wood, be carbonized, although the charcoal
formed is of a different nature. For the preparation of
phosphorus from bone-ash, see the article <a href="#PHOx">Phosphorus.</a></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXXIX. Of Clay.</i></p>

<p>Clay is an argillo-siliceous substance, of a colour more or
less yellow, and containing a variable quantity of silica and
alumina, with oxide of iron. There are a variety of clays;
the common potter's clay, pipe clay, porcelain clay, &amp;c.
Some contain, and others are free from iron. Those that contain
this metal burn <i>red</i>; while those which remain, or become
white in the process of burning, are free from it.</p>

<p>The use of clay in fire-works is confined nearly altogether
to rockets. In the driving of sky-rockets, &amp;c. the <i>charge</i>
must always be driven one diameter above the piercer, and
on it there is sometimes rammed one-third of a diameter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
clay, through the middle of which a hole is bored to the
composition, so that, when the charge is burnt to the top, it
may communicate its fire through the hole, to the stars in the
head. This, however, is not always the case. See <a href="#ROCx"><i>Rockets</i>.</a></p>

<p>The clay for fire-works, is usually prepared of the common
kind, which contains neither stones nor sand. It must
be first baked in an oven, until perfectly dry, and then pulverized,
and sifted through a common hair sieve. In China,
the Chinese mostly employ, for this purpose, their white porcelain
clay.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XL. Of Quicklime.</i></p>

<p>Lime, as it is found in nature, is combined with carbonic
and sulphuric acids, and less frequently with some of the
other acids, as the nitric, fluoric and phosphoric. Calcareous
carbonates are the most abundant; in which we include marble,
limestone, and chalk; and the sulphate, or gypsum, may
be considered the next. Lime constitutes the basis of marine
shells; for, when burnt, they furnish quicklime. Its
union with nitric acid is well known, forming the calcareous
nitre of the saltpetre caves of Kentucky, &amp;c. We have mentioned
this combination under the head of nitre.</p>

<p>Without enumerating all the chemical properties of lime,
it will be sufficient to remark, that it is composed of calcium
and oxygen, and, when slaked with water, will evolve
caloric in a free state, while the water solidifies or combines
with the lime; that it forms with water, a solid hydrate, an
example of which combination is afforded by the preparation
of mortar; that it dissolves in water, and forms lime-water,
and is slaked by exposure to the air, absorbing, at the same
time, carbonic acid; that it unites with acids, like other salifiable
bases, and forms salts, some of which are soluble in
water, and others not; that it deprives the alkalies of carbonic
acid, and renders them caustic, being itself changed
into a carbonate; and, that it unites with sulphur and phosphorus,
forming a sulphuret and phosphuret, and, also, with
hydroguretted sulphur, and sulphuretted hydrogen, forming
a hydroguretted sulphuret, and a hydro-sulphuret.</p>

<p>When limestone, marble, &amp;c. are burnt in a kiln, the carbonic
acid is expelled, and quicklime formed. Quicklime
and lime, chemically speaking, are synonimous terms.</p>

<p>The fluor, or Derbyshire spar, is a fluate of lime. When
this substance is distilled in a leaden retort, with sulphuric
acid, we have sulphate of lime, and fluoric acid gas, called
by some hydro-fluoric acid. This acid, when received in wa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>ter,
is used to etch on glass, in the same manner as nitric
acid on copper; and while applied in a liquid state, or in
that of gas, it acts on the glass, by combining with the silicon,
and is changed from the hydrofluoric, into the silicated
fluoric acid. If, instead of employing a leaden vessel, we
make use of a glass retort, or introduce powdered glass or
silica, into the leaden vessel, in either case, we obtain another
acid, which we have just mentioned, the silicated fluoric
acid; in consequence of the union of silicon with the supposed
radical of the fluoric acid, known by the name of fluorine.</p>

<p>Quicklime is occasionally, though but rarely, employed in
fire-works. That it increases the strength of powder, is asserted
by Dr. Bayne. See <a href="#GUNx">Gunpowder.</a> Its use in making
slow match, along with other substances, is given in the article
on that subject.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XLI. Of Lapis Calaminaris.</i></p>

<p>That some of the ores of zinc are employed in fire-works,
is evident from the use of lapis calaminaris, or calamine
stone, which is an impure carbonate of zinc. Calamine should
be finely pulverized and sifted. As zinc gives a particular
colour to flame, (see <a href="#ZINx"><i>zinc</i></a>), its carbonate may also communicate
a colour, and, under particular circumstances, may produce
a great variety, and, therefore, in such cases, be preferable
to the zinc itself. It is one of the ingredients in the
<i>dead fire</i> for wheels, which is composed of lapis calaminaris,
saltpetre, brimstone, and antimony.</p>

<p>The modifications, to which particular bodies are subject,
as to their respective effects, depend very greatly on the
presence of other bodies, and frequently on the chemical action,
which ensues throughout; so that, as we had occasion
to observe, the <i>effect</i> which one body would produce on the
flame, maybe completely changed, modified, or varied by the
presence of a second, third, or fourth substance. The art,
therefore, of uniting various bodies, in kind, as well as in
proportion, so as to produce a given effect, can be acquired
only by a series of experiments. Zinc, as a metal, when finely
divided, produces a peculiar effect; when mixed with other
metals, and with certain salts, as sal ammoniac, another; and,
when combined with some acids, as the carbonic in lapis calaminaris,
a third effect; and these effects may be governed,
as it appears, by the presence or absence of certain bodies.
This fact will appear more striking, when we consider the va<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>rious
mixtures, and their respective properties. For the uses
of zinc, see <a href="#ZINx">that article.</a></p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="ZINx" id="ZINx"></a><i>Sec. XLII. Of Zinc.</i></p>

<p>Zinc, commonly called spelter, is a metal, obtained from
blende, or sulphuret of zinc, and calamine, or carbonate of
zinc. The ore is first roasted, and then mixed with some
carbonaceous flux, and submitted to the action of heat in
close vessels. The metal is volatilized, and passes over, and
is usually caught in water. It is then fused, and cast in
moulds.</p>

<p>Zinc possesses many remarkable properties, some of which
are the following. It is of a brilliant white colour, with a
shade of blue, and is composed of a number of thin plates,
adhering together. Its specific gravity is more than six times
that of water. It is brittle, but, when heated to 212 degrees,
may be hammered out, or made into sheets. At 400° it
becomes very brittle. Its tenacity is so feeble, that a wire of
<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub></span>th of an inch in diameter, will support a weight of only
26 pounds. At 680° it melts, and above that temperature,
evaporates. It soon oxidizes, and its lustre is therefore tarnished.
At common temperatures, it soon decomposes water;
and, when the vapour of water is passed over it at a
high temperature, the decomposition is very rapid, the oxygen
of the water being absorbed. Zinc is soon oxidized
when melted and exposed to the air, forming a gray oxide.</p>

<p>At a red heat, zinc inflames, and the product of combustion
is the white oxide of zinc, or flowers. The oxide of
zinc is reduced by mixing it with charcoal, and exposing the
mixture to a strong heat in close vessels.</p>

<p>Zinc will burn in chlorine gas, and forms a chloride of
zinc. If the perchloride of mercury and zinc-filings be heated
together, the same compound will result. This chloride
melts at 212°, and rises, in the gaseous form, at a heat much
below ignition. It was formerly called the <i>butter of zinc</i>, and
muriate of zinc. With iodine, zinc forms a compound, called
iodide of zinc.</p>

<p>With phosphorus and sulphur, zinc also combines, and
with the latter, it forms the native sulphuret, known by
the name of blende. It unites, also, with acids, and forms
salts. Of these, the sulphate of zinc, or white vitriol, is
the most common. It unites with various metals, forming
alloys. Of these, that with copper, called brass, is the most
known. Zinc, with copper, forms galvanic batteries. With
tin and mercury, it constitutes amalgam for electrical ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>chines.
It forms, besides brass, the yellow copper, or laiton;
commonly called pinchbeck.</p>

<p>Acetic acid readily dissolves zinc. The acetate formed is
not altered by exposure to the air, is soluble in water, and
burns with a <i>blue</i> flame. It may be used, therefore, in fire-works,
to communicate that colour to flame. It may be formed
very expeditiously, by mixing about equal parts of sulphate
of zinc, and acetate of lead, both being in solution. The sulphate
of lead, which is formed, will precipitate, and acetate
of zinc remain in solution. By evaporation, it is obtained in
crystals. This salt cannot injure any composition of fire-work,
in which it enters; as it does not deliquesce, and, for
that reason, may be advantageously employed.</p>

<p>When zinc is used in fire-works, it should be remarkably
fine. The powder may be very readily formed, by heating it,
until it is about to fuse, and pulverizing it while hot, in a
warm mortar. It is generally considered, however, that the
best method of obtaining the powder of zinc, although a
longer time is required, is by filing it; but the filings are
more or less coarse, according to the file which is used. They
may be sifted, and thus obtained of any degree of fineness.
In various blue lights, in the blue flame of the parasol and
cascades, and other descriptions of fire-works, it is used. It
gives a more brilliant light than any other substance used for
this purpose. It is frequently mixed with other substances;
but, as to its peculiar properties, they remain the same. By
the combustion of zinc, which follows in fire-works, it always
produces an oxide. In this state, it is expelled, or
thrown off.</p>

<p>Acetate of zinc appears to possess advantages over zinc-filing,
especially as it produces the same colour, may be more
readily mixed, and with more accuracy, and does not deliquesce
or <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'absord'">absorb</ins> moisture, a circumstance which must always
be guarded against in artificial fire-works.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XLIII. Of Brass.</i></p>

<p>This is a mixed metal, composed of copper and zinc. This
alloy, according to the proportion of the metals, is more or
less yellow, or reddish-yellow. The yellow copper, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laiton</i>
of the French, the similor, Manheim gold, prince Rupert's
metal, &amp;c. are alloys of the same metals.</p>

<p>Zinc readily unites with copper; and the usual manner of
forming brass by brass-founders, is to make a direct union
between the two metals. The process, however, generally
consists in mixing together granulated copper, calamine, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
carbonated oxide of zinc, and charcoal in powder, and melting
them in a crucible. The charcoal reduces the zinc,
which then unites with the copper. The heat is kept up for
five or six hours, and towards the last of the process, is
raised.  Zinc, in small proportion, renders copper pale, and
in the proportion of one-twelfth, inclines its colour to yellow.
The yellow colour increases in intensity with the zinc, until
the weight of this metal in the alloy equals that of the copper.
An increase of zinc, afterwards makes the alloy white. English
brass contains one-third of its weight of zinc. In Germany
and Sweden, the proportion of zinc varies from one-fifth
to one-fourth of the copper. Twenty to forty parts of
zinc, with eighty to sixty parts of copper form the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuivre
jaune</i>, laiton, or yellow copper of the French.</p>

<p>Dutch metal, or Dutch gold, is a fine kind of brass, and
comes in leaf, which is about five times as thick as gold leaf.
This brass is made by the cementation of copper plates with
calamine, and hammered out into leaves.</p>

<p>According to Thenard (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de Chimie</cite>, tome i, p. 478),
the French use 50 parts of calamine, mixed intimately with
20 parts of charcoal, and stratified in a crucible with 30
parts of laminated, or granulated copper. British brass consists
of two parts of copper, and 1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> parts of zinc, by
weight.</p>

<p>The filings of brass are much employed in fire-works.
They communicate to stars, rains, &amp;c. a flame between a blue
and green. In some, the filings of copper alone are used.
A beautiful green fire, for instance, is produced by 16 ounces
of gunpowder, and 3<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> ounces of copper-filings. Verdigris
is also employed for the same purpose; but the effect
is not so striking, as in that preparation, the copper is already
oxidized. The effect of copper in fire-works, it is to be recollected,
depends, like that of other metals, on its combustion,
and consequent oxidizement. The product of the combustion
of brass, is oxide of copper, and oxide of zinc.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XLIV. Of Bronze.</i></p>

<p>The union of copper with tin, in various proportions,
forms gun-metal, bell-metal, the mirrors of telescopes, and
bronze.</p>

<p>The ductility of the copper is diminished by the tin; but
its hardness, and tenacity, as well as its fusibility and sonorousness
are increased.</p>

<p>To form a complete union of the two metals, they should
be continued in fusion for some time, and constantly stirred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
The tin is apt to rise to the surface, unless this precaution
is used.</p>

<p>Bronze is usually composed of 100 parts of copper, and
8 to 12 parts of tin. It is yellow, brittle, heavier than copper,
and has more tenacity.</p>

<p>The same metals, and in the same proportion, constitute
gun-metal. In the brass ordnance made at Woolwich, the
proportion of tin varies from 8 to 12, to the 100 parts of
copper. The purest copper requires the most. That the alloy
is more sonorous than iron, is evident from the report of
brass pieces, being louder than that occasioned by iron
guns.</p>

<p>When the alloy is 78 of copper and 22 of tin, it is chiefly
used for clocks. There is, in the English metal, about five
per cent. of zinc, and four per cent. of lead. The proportion
of tin, in bell-metal, varies. In church bells, less tin is
used than for small bells. In the latter, zinc is sometimes
added.</p>

<p>The <i>Tam-tam</i>, or <i>gong</i> of the Chinese, used for cymbals,
clocks, mirrors, &amp;c. contains, according to analysis, 80 parts
of copper, and 20 parts of tin. The proportions, however,
are not always the same.</p>

<p>The ancients made cutting instruments of an alloy of copper
and tin. A dagger, analyzed by Mr. Hielm, consisted
of 83<span class="xs"><sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> copper, and 16<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> tin. Vessels of bronze were
frequently covered with silver. Some of this kind were
found in the ruins of Herculaneum.</p>

<p>Pliny observes, that ancient mirrors were made with a
mixture of copper and tin; but that, in his time, those of
silver were so common, that they were even used by the maid
servants. The quantity of tin, to make the most perfect
speculum, depends on the quality of the copper. If the proportion
of tin be too small, the composition will be yellowish;
if it be too great, the composition will be of a grayish-blue
colour. Mr. Edwards casts the speculum in sand with
its face downwards; takes it out while red-hot, and places it
in hot wood-ashes to cool, otherwise it would break in cooling.
The mixture is first granulated, by pouring it into water,
and then fused a second time for casting. Mr. Little
recommends the following proportions: 32 parts of the best
bar copper, 4 parts of brass, or pin wire, 16<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> of tin, and
1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> of arsenic.</p>

<p>Whether for speculum metal, bronze, or gun-metal, the
metals must be mixed exactly, and for this purpose be kept a
long time in fusion, and constantly stirred; otherwise, the
alloy will not be of a uniform quality, as the greater part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the copper will sink to the bottom, and the greater part of
the tin rise to the surface. When we speak of <i>brass guns</i>,
as that name is generally applied to them, we are to understand,
that they are not made, like brass, of an alloy of copper
and zinc.</p>

<p>The ancient metallic mirrors, which were in use before
the present mirrors, or the discovery of glass, and the mode
of applying to its surface an amalgam of tin, were composed
of two parts of copper and one part of tin. Mr. Mudge
asserts, that the best proportion for mirrors is 32 parts of
copper and 14.5 parts of tin. Klaproth found a specimen of
ancient mirror to consist of 32 of tin, 8 of lead, and 62 of
copper. The alloys of copper and tin may be decomposed
by dissolving them in an acid, the muriatic for instance, and
immersing a sheet of iron, which will precipitate the copper.
The tin may then be separated by immersing a plate of lead,
or zinc, by either of which metals, it will be precipitated.</p>

<p>Bronze, being a mixed metal, in which the copper forms
the principal ingredient, is sometimes used in fire-works, in
lieu of copper or brass; for its effects are similar. By the
combustion of bronze filings, we have an oxide of copper
and an oxide of tin.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XLV. Of Mosaic Gold.</i></p>

<p>This name, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aurum musivum</i>, was given to a preparation
of tin, composed of tin and sulphur. It is considered to be
a persulphuret of tin.</p>

<p>Several methods are recommended for preparing this substance.
The oldest process is to sublime a mixture of 12 parts
of tin, 7 parts of sulphur, 3 parts of mercury, and 3 parts of
sal ammoniac. It may be formed by heating together in a
retort, a mixture of equal parts of sulphur and oxide of tin.</p>

<p>It is used principally for rubbing the cushions of electrical
machines, and for bronzing wood. In fire-works, it is sometimes
employed under the name of <i>gold-powder</i>.</p>

<p>It was supposed to be a combination of sulphur with the
oxide of tin. Dr. J. Davy (<cite>Phil. Trans.</cite> 1812, p. 199) and
Berzelius, (<cite>Nich. Jour.</cite> xxxv, 165), have proved, however,
that it is nothing more than metallic tin and sulphur; the proportions
of which, according to the former, are 100 of tin
+ 56.25 of sulphur.</p>

<p>Mosaic gold is of a yellow colour, resembling that of gold.
It is insoluble in water, and is not acted upon by muriatic or
nitric acid. The nitromuriatic, however, decomposes it. A
solution of caustic potassa dissolves it, forming a green so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>lution,
which is decomposed by acids, letting fall a hydrosulphuret
of tin. It deflagrates with nitre.</p>

<p>When it is used in fire-works, it is pulverized, and sifted.
It is more generally employed as a pigment to impart a golden
colour to small statues of plaster-paris. When mixed
with melted glass, it is said to imitate lapis lazuli.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="IROx" id="IROx"></a><i>Sec. XLVI. Of Iron and Steel.</i></p>

<p>Both iron and steel are used abundantly in fire-works. It
would be unnecessary to detail the preparations, in which
they are employed, which may be seen by a reference to the
different kinds of fire, and to their respective formulæ.</p>

<p>Cast iron is more employed in artificial fire than forged
iron or steel, at least in the preparation of some, as gerbes,
white fountains, and Chinese fire.</p>

<p>The filings of iron and steel may be sifted through sieves.
A fine hair sieve will answer for common purposes. Their
fineness depends, in the first instance, on the file, which is
used. Steel or iron filings are more commonly employed in
the compositions for brilliant fire.</p>

<p>The sparks produced by cast-iron are very brilliant; but
the reduction of the iron to powder, or to a degree of fineness
sufficient for use, is a difficult operation. It is of too
hard a nature to be cut by a file.</p>

<p>This operation is generally performed in the following
manner: Procure from an iron foundry, some thin pieces of
cast iron, such as generally run over the mould at the time of
casting, and pound them on a block, made of cast iron, with
an iron hammer of four pounds weight, putting, under the
block, a cloth to catch the pieces of iron, which fly off. They
are beaten with the hammer in this manner, until the whole
is reduced to grains, which are more or less small. It is
then thrown into a sieve, which should be fine, and the dust
separated. This is used, in the place of steel dust, in small
cases of brilliant fire. The remainder is then put into a sieve,
a little coarser, and again sifted. This portion is preserved
separately. The same operation is repeated, but with sieves
of different sizes, till the iron passes through about the bigness
of small bird shot.</p>

<p>The pulverization may be effected in an iron mortar, with a
steel pestle, having the mortar covered in the usual manner,
to prevent the escape of the finer particles of the iron.</p>

<p>According to a writer in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire de l'Industrie</cite>,
vol. iii, p. 34, the Chinese prepare their iron-sand for fire-works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
by igniting iron, and plunging it in cold water. They
then pulverize the scales thus formed, and pass the powder
obtained, through different sized sieves, which is then called
No. 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. as it is very fine or coarse. This cannot
be a good method, and we doubt whether it is at present employed;
because it is obvious, that the scales, in this case,
consist of the metal in the state of protoxide. D'Incarville,
a missionary at Pekin, obtained the process for making Chinese
fire; and observes, that the pulverized cast iron they
employ is called <i>iron-sand</i>, of which they have six numbers
or varieties.</p>

<p>As the goodness of iron or steel dust, in fire-works, depends
greatly on its being dry, and not oxidized or rusted; its
preservation must be accordingly attended to. The usual
preservative is to put it in a box, lined with oiled paper, and
covered with the same, or in tin cannisters, with their mouths
well closed.</p>

<p>When it is to be used, it is taken according to its size,
and in proportion to the cases, for which the charge is intended.
Large gerbes, of 6 or 8 lbs. require only the coarse
sort.</p>

<p>As the brilliancy of the sparks, produced by the iron and
steel dust, is a desideratum in the formation of some fire-works,
and as this brilliancy depends upon the nature and
quality of the metal, it may not be improper to offer some
remarks on these subjects.</p>

<p>That iron, when finely divided is capable of producing
sparks of fire, is a well known fact; and we see it daily in
the operations of the smith, when ignited iron is hammered
on the anvil. The scintillation produced by the steel, when
struck with a flint, is of the same character. In the latter
case, the metal is actually fused, and, when caught on a
paper, and examined with a microscope, will appear globular,
and partly oxidized. Hence it is, that gunpowder is inflamed
by this spark, which is nothing more than highly
ignited, and inflamed iron, possessing a temperature more
than sufficient to inflame gunpowder.</p>

<p>The effect, therefore, that results from the inflammation of
fire-works, in which iron or steel forms a constituent part, is
nothing more than a vivid combustion of the metal; and
during that process it becomes oxidized, as it does not form
an acid with oxygen, like arsenic, antimony, and some other
metals.</p>

<p>The combustion of iron or steel may be shown by a very
brilliant experiment, that of burning it in oxygen gas. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
steel wire, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'harpsicord'">harpsichord</ins> wire for instance, formed into a spiral,
with a small piece of wood dipped in sulphur, stuck on its
end and then set on fire, upon being immediately introduced
into a bottle, containing pure oxygen gas, will burn with
great brilliancy, emitting a number of sparks or scintillations,
which fall like rain. In making the experiment, some
sand should be put into the bottle to prevent the sparks from
breaking it. This experiment illustrates the rapid combustion
of iron, or steel. For the oxygen gas supports the combustion;
and while the oxygen is actually taken up by the metal,
which becomes oxidized, and therefore increased in weight,
in the same manner as it does when inflamed in fire-works,
the caloric, the other constituent of oxygen gas, is given out
in a free state, and, with the light at the same time evolved,
produces the phenomena of combustion.</p>

<p>Many other experiments might be mentioned, in which
the same effects take place, and from which the same conclusions
may be drawn. But with respect to the <i>effect</i>,
whether it be dull, brilliant, or very brilliant, depends more
on the quality of the metal, than perhaps, on its subsequent
mixture with the other materials. Crude iron, usually called
cast iron, seems to possess this property in an eminent degree;
but in the experiment with oxygen gas, steel is always
preferable, as the combustion is more rapid, and the effect
more striking. The difference, which we will not attempt
to explain, may depend on the <i>state</i>, as well as the <i>proportion</i>
of carbon, which enters into crude iron, as well as steel.
In one case, the combustion ensues in contact with nitre, and
in atmospheric air; in the other, in contact only with oxygen
gas. Be this as it may, this inference is conclusive, that,
in all cases of the combustion of iron in fire-works, the metal
itself unites with oxygen, and the result of the combustion
is an oxide of iron; and with respect to the carbon, in both
instances, it is converted alike into carbonic acid. So that
whether the iron receives its oxygen from the nitre, or from
the air, or from both, is immaterial, as the products are the
same.</p>

<p>When iron is exposed to the atmosphere, it tarnishes, and
is gradually changed into a brown or yellow powder, called
rust. This change is owing to its combination with oxygen;
and its affinity for oxygen is such, that, when the vapour of
water is made to pass through an ignited gun-barrel, it is
decomposed, the metal becoming oxidized, and the hydrogen,
the other constituent of the water, being liberated in the
form of gas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Gun barrels are browned by a process of oxidizement.
There are several processes recommended. One of which
is, to rub the barrel over with diluted nitric or muriatic
acid, and then, to lay it by for a week or two, until a complete
coat of rust is formed. A brush, made of iron wire, is
then applied; afterwards, oil and wax, and the barrel is finished
by rubbing it with a cloth. The gunsmiths in Philadelphia
use a mixed solution of sulphate of copper, tincture of
the muriate of iron, and sweet spirit of nitre. This they apply
by means of a cloth. The object is to form a rust, and to
render it permanent on the barrel by hard friction along
with wax. When sulphate of copper is employed, metallic
copper is precipitated on the barrel. A coat of rust, put on
in this manner, prevents effectually the oxidizement of the
iron; and in point of utility, and the saving of labour in
polishing and keeping muskets in order, the browning of barrels
is certainly advantageous in the land service. At sea, in
particular, where iron is more readily oxidized, this plan
ought always to be adopted. With regard to the use of
dragon's blood, it is entirely too temporary in its effect to be
depended on. I was informed by an intelligent gunsmith,
who followed the practice of browning barrels in Europe, that
he has known the <i>browning</i> to remain very perfect for years,
and that the best mode of insuring its durability is to use
the <i>steel brush</i>, which <i>carries in</i>, as he expressed it, the
rust.</p>

<p>The oxides, which are formed by the union of oxygen
with iron, are two; namely, the black and the red; the first
being the protoxide, and the last the peroxide. The black
oxide, which is formed by the combustion of iron, and by
other processes, contains 56 iron + 16 oxygen. The common
rust of iron is the peroxide of this metal, combined
with carbonic acid. It may be formed by exposing the
protosulphate of iron, or green vitriol, in solution, to the atmosphere,
and then adding an alkali. This oxide contains
more oxygen than the preceding; it consisting of 56 iron +
24 oxygen.</p>

<p>The tempering of cutting instruments, an operation which
requires great delicacy and exactness, after that of hardening,
is intended to obtain a fine and durable edge; and as
this subject may be interesting in a military point of view,
we deem the following remarks of use.</p>

<p>The hardening of steel instruments is performed by heating
them to a cherry-red, and then immersing them in cold
water. The tempering is another process, calculated, as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
observed, to obtain a fine and durable edge. This is performed
by heating oil to a certain temperature, and plunging
the instrument into it, where it remains until the colour appears,
indicative of the particular kind of temper which is
intended to be given. The experiments of Stoddart, (<cite>Nicholson's
Quarto Journal</cite>, iv, 129,) are conclusive on this subject;
for his experiments prove, that, between 430° and 450°
the instrument assumes a pale yellowish tinge: at 460° the
colour is a straw-yellow, and the instrument has the usual
temper of pen-knives, razors, and other fine edge tools. The
colour gradually deepens as the temperature rises, and at
500° becomes a bright brownish metallic yellow. As the
heat increases, the surface is successively yellow, brown,
red, and purple, to 580°, when it becomes of a uniform deep
blue, like that of watch springs. Before the instrument becomes
red-hot, the blue changes to a water colour, which is
the last distinguishable colour. These different shades are
owing to the oxidizement of the surface of the metal; and
the art of ornamenting <i>sword-blades</i>, knives, &amp;c. long practised
in Sheffield, depends on this principle. The general process
is, that an oily composition is used, with which flowers
and various ornaments are painted. On the application of
the heat required for tempering it, that part which was covered
with the composition, is not altered, whereas, the
uncovered parts of the blade are changed. These ornaments,
when the paint is removed, have the natural colour of polished
steel. When steel is heated in hydrogen gas, no appearance
of the kind takes place, a fact which shows, that it is
owing to the oxidizement of the metal.</p>

<p>Iron is soluble in the acids. By the assistance of water, it
is acted upon by sulphuric acid; the metal being oxidized,
and the oxide dissolved, while hydrogen gas is evolved.
The salt, formed in this case, is the sulphate of iron, green
vitriol, or copperas. With muriatic, nitric, acetic and other
acids, it forms various salts; and with gallic acid, when the
iron is peroxidized, it forms the pergallate of iron, or common
writing ink, and also the bases of black dye.</p>

<p>Iron unites with carbon, sulphur and phosphorus. Of the
sulphurets, there are two kinds, the protosulphuret and persulphuret.
The former is the magnetic pyrites, and the latter,
cubic pyrites, from both of which, green vitriol is obtained
by decomposition. Pyrites, we may observe, was the
original fire-stone, or the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">feuer-stein</i> of the Germans, which
was used in the place of flint. See <cite>Beckman's History of
Invention</cite>. Iron also unites with some of the metals, forming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
alloys. The white iron of the French, (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fer blanc</i>,) or tin
plate of the English, is found to be any alloy of tin with
iron, as well as a covering of tin on iron.</p>

<p>Sheet tin, or tinplate which is necessary in the construction
of the apparatus for some fire-works, for canister shot,
&amp;c. is made by immersing sheets of iron, previously freed
from rust, into melted tin. The number of dippings it undergoes,
determines, in some measure, its quality and character.</p>

<p>The union of carbon and iron, forming very important
modifications of this metal, is not only interesting in the military
art, as concerns the metal for cannon, small arms, and
fire-works, but also in relation to the many and highly useful
compounds which result.</p>

<p>All the varieties of iron, which are distinguished by artists,
under particular names, we may consider under the following
heads: namely; cast iron, wrought or soft iron, and
steel.</p>

<p>Cast or pig iron is the name of this metal, when first obtained
from the ore. The ores of iron are various, and contain
a greater or less quantity of iron, which is either combined
with oxygen, or found with clay, giving rise to two
important classes of iron ore, the calciform and the argillaceous.
The reduction of the ore merely requires the presence
of charcoal, and occasionally some addition, as limestone,
when the clay iron ores are to be reduced. On the
application of heat in furnaces, constructed for the purpose,
the charcoal unites with the oxygen of the oxide, reducing
it to the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'metalic'">metallic</ins> state, and escapes in the form of carbonic
acid; and the lime, if the ore be argillaceous, unites with the
clay, forming a kind of glass, which floats on the melted metal.
When the iron is suffered to run into moulds, prepared
for its reception, it usually takes the name of pig iron.</p>

<p>Manufacturers distinguish cast iron by its colour and
other qualities. The <i>white cast iron</i> is hard and brittle, and
can neither be filed, bored, nor bent. Gray mottled iron, so
called from its colour, is of a granulated texture, softer, and
may be cut, bored and turned on the lathe. Cannon are
made of this iron. <i>Black cast iron</i> is the most unequal in
its texture, but the most fusible.</p>

<p>Cast iron melts at 130° of Wedgwood. Its specific gravity
varies from 7.2 to 7.6. It is converted into malleable, usually
called soft iron, by a process called refinement. Several
modes have been adopted for this purpose. It was formerly
done by keeping it in fusion in a bed of charcoal and ashes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>,
and afterwards forging it. The hammering makes the particles
of iron approach each other, and expels some impurities.</p>

<p>Among the various improvements for expeditiously and effectually
converting crude into malleable iron, the process of
Mr. Cort seems to possess advantages. The cast iron is
melted in a reverberatory furnace, and the flame of the combustible
is made to act upon the melted matter. It is stirred
during this operation, by which means, every part is exposed
to the air. A lambent blue flame begins to appear in about
an hour, and the mass swells. The heat is continued about
an hour longer; and, by this time, the iron acquires more
consistency, and finally congeals. While still hot, it is next
hammered by powerful tilt-hammers. This is called the
<i>puddling</i> process.</p>

<p>Iron, obtained in this way, is not however pure; for it contains
either some of the other metals, or oxygen, carbon, silicon,
or phosphorus.</p>

<p>When small pieces of iron are stratified in a crucible with
charcoal powder, and exposed to a strong heat for eight or
ten hours, they are converted into steel. Steel is brittle, resists
the file, cuts glass, and affords sparks with flint. It
loses its hardness by ignition and cooling. It is malleable at
a red heat. It melts at 130 degrees of Wedgwood. By being
repeatedly ignited in an open vessel, it becomes, by hammering,
wrought iron.</p>

<p>Natural steel is that which is formed, by converting the
ore first into cast-iron, and exposing it to the action of a
strong heat, while the melted scoriæ float on its surface.
This steel is inferior to the others. Steel of cementation is
formed, on a large scale, by stratifying bars of iron with
charcoal, in large earthen troughs or crucibles, the mouths of
which are closed with clay. These troughs are put in furnaces,
and, in eight or ten days, the process is finished. This
is also called blistered steel, on account of the appearance of
its surface. The tilted steel is that which is beaten out into
small bars by the hammer. When broken, and the pieces
again united by welding in a furnace, and made into bars, it
is then called German or shear steel.</p>

<p>Cast steel is considered the most valuable of all the varieties;
and is used for the manufacture of razors, surgeons'
instruments, &amp;c. It is, besides, more fusible than common
steel, and for that reason, cannot be welded with iron. It is
made by melting the blistered steel, in a close crucible, along
with pounded glass, and charcoal powder. It may also be formed
by melting together 30 parts of iron, 1 part of charcoal, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
1 part of glass. Equal parts of chalk and clay, put with
iron in a crucible, will also produce it.</p>

<p>The Celtiberians in Spain had a singular mode of preparing
steel. Diodorus and Plutarch both say, that the iron was
buried in the earth, and left in that situation, till the greater
part of it was converted into rust. What remained, without
being oxidized, was afterwards forged and made into weapons,
and particularly swords, with which they could cut asunder
bones, shields, and helmets. This process is used in Japan,
however improbable it may seem; and Swedenbourg, among the
different methods of making steel, has introduced it. Bishop
Watson, (<cite>Chemical Essays</cite> 8vo. i, p. 220,) speaks of the
same process. The fact has been verified at Gottingen; for
an anvil, which had been buried in the ground for many years,
was found to be extremely soft; and a part of it, which appeared
in steel-like grains, possessed the properties of steel.</p>

<p>The sabres made in Japan, according to Thunberg, are incomparable.
Without hurting the edge, they can be made
to cut through a nail at one blow.</p>

<p>The art of hardening steel by immersion in cold water is
very old. Homer (<cite>Odyssia</cite> ix, 301,) says, that, when Ulysses
bored out the eye of Polyphemus with a burning stake,
it hissed in the same manner as water, when the smith immerses
in it a piece of red-hot iron, in order to harden it.
Sophocles, Salmasius, Pliny, Justin and others mention the
use of water in hardening iron; but the most delicate articles
of that metal were not quenched in water, but in oil. As to
the opinion of the peculiar virtue of any particular water, for
the purpose of hardening iron, which many have believed, it
is altogether fallacious, although Vasari asserts, that the archduke
Cosmo, in 1555, discovered a water, that would harden
instruments, to cut, like the ancient tools, the hardest porphyry.
The art of working porphyry, however, was known
in every age. Beckman assures us, when treating of the
processes of making steel, that the invention and art of converting
bar iron into steel, by dipping it into other fused iron,
and suffering it to remain there several hours, although
ascribed to Reaumur, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Art de Convertir le Fer en Acier</cite>, p.
145), are mentioned by Agricola, Imperati, and others, as a
thing well known and practised in their time.</p>

<p>Pliny, Diamachus, and other ancient writers mention various
countries and places, which, in their time, produced excellent
steel. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ferrum Indicum</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sericum</i> were the
dearest kinds. The former is the same as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ferrum candidum</i>,
a hundred talents of which were given, as a present,
to Alexander in India.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Beckman thinks, that the ancient <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ferrum candidum</i> is the
same kind of steel still common in India, and known under
the name of <i>wootz</i>; some pieces of which were sent from
Bombay in 1795 to the Royal Society. Its silver coloured
appearance, when polished, he thinks, may have given rise to
the epithet of <i>candidum</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Faraday of the Royal Institution has lately examined
wootz, and imitated it very accurately. The experiments
may be seen in <cite>Ure's Chemical Dictionary</cite>, article <i>Iron</i>. It
appears that the presence of silex and alumina distinguishes
this kind of steel from the English. Four hundred and sixty
grains of wootz gave 0.3 of a grain of silex, and 0.6 of
a grain of alumina. It is highly probable, that the much admired
sabres of Damascus, are made from this steel.</p>

<p>A small portion of silver, melted with steel, improves the
latter very considerably. One part of silver and five hundred
parts of steel were melted together, and every part of
the alloy formed, when tested, indicated silver. The alloy forged
remarkably well, although very hard, and was pronounced to
be superior to the very best steel. This excellence is undoubtedly
owing to its combination with the silver, however small.
The alloy has been repeatedly made, and with the same success.
Various cutting tools have been made from it of the
best quality. The silver is found to give a mechanical
toughness to the steel.</p>

<p>Platinum and steel, equal parts by weight, form a beautiful
alloy, which takes a fine polish, and does not tarnish.
This alloy is said to make the best speculum. Steel, for
edge tools, is improved by this metal. The proportions,
which appear to be most proper, are from one to three per
cent. An alloy of 10 platinum with 80 of steel, after exposure
for many months, had not a speck on its surface.
Would not this alloy, as it is not oxidized, be very useful for
making points for lightning rods, in lieu of iron, gold, silver,
or platinum alone? The experiment is worth a trial; for
nothing adds more to the safety of a magazine, or building,
against the effect of lightning, than a conductor.</p>

<p>Iron and carbon, it appears, are capable of uniting in different
proportions; hence the variety of crude iron, and the
different kinds of steel. When the carbon exceeds the iron,
as in plumbago, or black lead, it forms a carburet. When
the iron exceeds, such compounds are properly speaking sub-carburets;
under which name, we may rank all the varieties
of cast iron and steel.</p>

<p>The hardness of iron, according to the experiments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Mushet, (<cite>Phil. Mag.</cite> xiii, p. 138), increases with the proportion
of charcoal, with which it combines, until the carbon
amounts to about <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>60</sub></span>th of the whole mass. This is the maximum,
the metal acquiring the colour of silver. More carbon
diminishes the hardness, according to its quantity. The difference
in iron, whether it be the <i>cold-short</i>, or <i>hot-short</i> iron,
a matter of some consequence to the workers in this metal,
was found to be owing to phosphoric acid in the cold-short,
which exists with the iron. But the substance, called <i>siderum</i>
by Bergman, is a phosphuret, and not a phosphate of iron.</p>

<p>We have gone into this subject more fully, on account of
its importance, and intimate connection with the casting of
guns, and the different qualities of iron. In fire-works, it
will appear obvious, that the various properties exhibited by
iron are owing to the iron and carbon, to the changes which
they undergo, to the combustion which necessarily ensues,
and to the production of oxide of iron, and carbonic acid
gas; effects that invariably take place, whether cast iron or
steel be used, provided it is exposed to the action of agents,
under the same circumstances and conditions.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XLVII. Of Glass.</i></p>

<p>Glass, in the form of powder or dust, is used in fire-works.
The pulverization of glass is easily performed. It may be
done in an iron mortar, and passed though fine wire or brass
sieves. It is used in the composition for wheels, in water
balloons, cones, fire-pumps, slow white fire, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Glass is nothing more than fused silica, made by exposing
a mixture of silica and other substances to the action of a
violent heat.</p>

<p>The quality of the glass depends on the proportion of silica,
and the fluxes which are used in promoting its fusion; for
the various kinds of glass, as white glass, green glass, bottle
glass, &amp;c. are all, in one respect, the same, though they differ
in these particulars.</p>

<p>The glass of Saint-Gobin in France is made by fusing
white sand, lime, soda, and broken inferior glass. The white
goblet-glass is made of sand, potash, lime, and old glass; the
quantity of potash is about fifty per cent. If green, or yellow,
the colour is destroyed by the addition of black oxide of
manganese; and hence that oxide is named <i>glass makers'
soap</i>.</p>

<p>The common plate glass, for electrical machines, &amp;c. is
formed of sand, crude soda, old glass, and oxide of manga<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>nese.
The bottle glass, made with the soda of marine plants,
consists of sand, soda, common ashes, and old glass. Another
bottle glass is made by melting common sand, black or yellow,
with soda, wood-ashes, clay, and broken glass. It appears
from the use of the substances which enter into, and
compose, glass, that its quality is owing to the materials employed.
The crystal or flint glass is a finer kind. The substances,
with the proportions in which they are used, are the
following:</p>

<p class="p1">To this is added, if the vitrification is not complete, some
muriate of soda. Good glass, according to Pajot des
Charmes, may be made by fusing equal parts of carbonate of
lime, sand, and sulphate of soda. The glass is clear, solid,
and of a pale yellow. Professor Scheweigger found, that the
following proportions were the best:</p>

<p class="p1">Broad glass is made of a mixture of soap-boilers' waste,
kelp, and sand. Two of waste, one of kelp, and one of sand
are the proportions generally employed. Common bottle
glass is usually made of waste and river sand, to which lime,
and clay, and common salt are occasionally added.</p>

<p>The coloured glasses are produced by various metallic
oxides. The colour and beauty of precious stones are thus
imitated. These colours are communicated by sundry metallic
preparations, as the following: The purple powder of
Cassius, with oxide of manganese, will give a red or purple
according to the proportions used; zaffre, an oxide of cobalt,
a blue; a mixture of oxide of cobalt, muriate of silver, or glass
of antimony, a green; and oxide of manganese, a violet, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The basis of all artificial precious stones, is composed of
what is called glass-paste, a compound of silica, potash,
borax, red lead, and sometimes arsenic. These substances
are melted together. The glass, which forms the body of
the artificial gem, is pulverized, and the colouring substances
are blended with it by sifting; and then the whole must
be carefully fused, being left on the fire for from 24 to 30
hours, and cooled very slowly. The following proportions
are used for this purpose:</p>

<p>The ancient coloured glass has been much admired. The
art was carried to a very great extent. Even in Pliny's time,
the highest price was set upon glass entirely free from colour.
He, as well as others, mentions that hyacinths and
sapphires were imitated very exactly.</p>

<p>The emperor Adrian received as a present from an
Egyptian priest, several glass cups richly ornamented with
various coloured glass. Seneca speaks of the knowledge of
Democritus in this art. Porta, Neri, and others, in modern
times, have treated the subject in a more enlarged manner.
Coloured glass was used for ornament; but Pollio relates,
that Gallenius punished an impostor for selling to his wife
a piece of glass for a jewel. In the <i>Museum Victorium</i> at
Rome, are several ancient artificial gems, such as the chrysolite
and emerald. What materials the ancients used for colouring
glass is not known. Gmelin, however, observes,
that it is probable they made use of iron, by which, he
adds, not only all the shades of red, violet and yellow, but even
a blue colour might be communicated. Cassius discovered
the powder which bears his name. He was a physician, and
resided at Lubec.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> This powder was employed by the German
artists. While noticing this subject, it may be proper
to state, that Libavius (<cite>Alchemy</cite>, 1606,) gives a process for
making ruby glass. Neri, (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">ars vitraria</cite> by Kunkel,) was
acquainted with the gold-purple and its use. Glauber (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Furnus
Philosophicus</cite>, 1648) mentions the use, and gives the preparation
of the powder. Kunkel made artificial rubies in
great abundance, and a cup of ruby glass for the elector of
Cologne. In 1679, he was inspector of the glass houses at
Potsdam; and, in perfecting the art, he expended 1600<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
ducats, which the elector of Brandenburgh gave him for the
purpose.</p>

<p>M. Brongniart has lately made many experiments on the
subject of staining glass. The colours, however, are the same
as we noticed. A green glass may be made by putting on
one side of the glass a blue, and on the other a yellow. A
black glass may be made by a mixture of blue with the oxides
of manganese and iron. Painting on glass is an ancient
art. When pieces of old painted glass are examined, they
have always on one side a transparent red <i>varnish</i> burnt into
them. The moderns, however, excel in this art.</p>

<p>Glass is not acted upon by the acids, except the fluoric or
hydrofluoric. Hence the acid of Derbyshire spar, which is
a fluate of lime, is used for etching on glass, in the same
manner as nitric acid is, on copper. Fluoric acid, a compound
of fluorine and hydrogen, is decomposed during this
action, and is changed, by the union of its fluorine with silicon,
into the silicated fluoric acid.</p>

<p>When a quantity of alkali is used just sufficient to fuse
silica, glass is the result; but when the quantity is greater, as
three or four to one, the fused mass is soluble in water, and
then forms the silicated alkali, or liquor of flints. From
this the silica is obtained in a pure state, by the addition of
an acid.</p>

<p>Glass, when melted and dropped into water, assumes an
oval form, with a slender projection, called a tail. This is
called Prince Rupert's drop. If a small part of this tail be
broken off, the whole bursts into powder, with a kind of explosion.
The Bologna, or philosophical phial, is a small
cylindrical vessel of glass, rounded at the bottom, but open
at the upper end. It is made thick at the bottom, so as not
to be easily broken; but if a pebble be dropped into it, it immediately
cracks, and the whole falls into pieces. In both
these, (the drop and the bottle,) the glass is unannealed.
When the external part of glass is suddenly cooled, the inner
part is kept, as it were, contracted. Now annealing, the process
of tempering glass in an oven, renders the glass uniformly
alike, and capable of sustaining the variations of
temperature, without breaking. By a crack or fissure,
the internal parts which remained in a state of tension, endeavour
to recover the full state of expansion, and consequently
the glass is rent asunder.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XLVIII. Glue and Isinglass.</i></p>

<p>Both glue and isinglass are animal products. They are used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
in fire-works, but always in the state of solution, as vehicles
to mix up compositions in order to make them unite, and to
preserve them from falling to powder. The quantity, however,
is never large, or either would destroy the effect. The
proportions are generally prescribed. A solution of glue is
employed in the old process for refining saltpetre. See <a href="#NITw"><i>Nitre</i>.</a>
In making priming paste, isinglass dissolved in brandy is
sometimes used.</p>

<p>Glue and isinglass owe their adhesive quality to the presence
of gelatin; the most remarkable property of which is, that it
unites with, and precipitates the tanning principle from its
solution in water. For this reason, the use of oak bark and
other astringent substances, in the tanning of leather, is obvious,
the gelatin of the hide or skin, uniting with the tannin
and forming tanned leather. Gelatin exists in bones,
muscles, tendons, ligaments, membranes and skins. Skins,
especially those of old animals, furnish the best and strongest
glue.</p>

<p>For the preparation of glue, the parings and offals of
hides, pelts, and the hoofs and ears of horses, oxen, calves,
sheep, &amp;c. are first digested in lime-water to clean them;
then steeped in fresh water, which is suffered to run off; and
being previously inclosed in a strong linen bag, are boiled in
a copper cauldron with pure water. The impurities are removed
as they rise. To the solution, alum, or finely powdered
lime, is added. It is then strained through baskets and
allowed to settle; after which, the clear fluid is again boiled.
When it becomes thick, or of a proper consistence, it is poured
into moulds or frames, when it concretes into jelly. It
is cut into pieces by a spade, and then into thin slices by
means of wire, and finally dried on coarse net-work.</p>

<p>The goodness of glue is known by its brittleness, and equal
degree of transparency, without black spots. It swells up in
cold water, and becomes gelatinous, but does not dissolve.
It is a mark of want of <i>strength</i>, when glue dissolves in cold
water.</p>

<p>Size is also a gelatinous substance, and is colourless and
transparent. Eel skins, vellum, parchment, &amp;c. are used in
its preparation. They are treated in the same manner as
hides. Isinglass, or fish glue, is a finer kind of gelatin, obtained
from the air bladder and sounds of different kinds of
fish of the <i>accipenser</i> genus; as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sturio stellatus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">huso ruthenses</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> The bladder, when taken from the fish, is
washed and stripped of its exterior membrane, and then cut
lengthwise and formed into rolls, or cut into strips. Isinglass
dissolves in water with more difficulty than glue. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
coarser kind of fish glue is made from sea wolves, porpoises,
sharks, cuttle fish, the sturgeon, &amp;c. The head, tail, fins, &amp;c.
are boiled in water, and the solution evaporated. Isinglass
is used for a variety of purposes, as the making of court
plaster and size, the clarification of liquors, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Isinglass is almost wholly gelatin. One hundred grains
give ninety-eight of soluble matter.</p>

<p>Gelatin constitutes the greater part of the solid parts of
animals, such as bone, ligament, muscle, membrane, skin, &amp;c.
and is always extracted by boiling them in water. We need
hardly remark, that it constitutes the chief part of soup,
which owes its nutritive qualities principally to its presence.
The portable soup is nothing more than concrete gelatin, with
other substances, as spices, salt, &amp;c.; for it contains, in a
small compass, the nutritive parts of beef, veal, and other animal
substances, from which it may have been prepared.</p>

<p>Besides the use of water for extracting, or otherwise separating,
the gelatin from bone, we may separate the phosphate
of lime entirely from the latter, (as these two substances constitute
the greater part of bone), by the action of dilute muriatic
acid, which will dissolve the phosphate of lime, and
leave the gelatin.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sect. XLIX. Of Wood.</i></p>

<p>Of the kinds of wood, used for the preparation of coal, for
the purpose of gunpowder, those should be preferred, which
are light, and will give a tender charcoal. This subject was
fully considered under that head.</p>

<p>But our intention, in noticing wood at this time, is, that it
is employed in the composition of some fire-works in the
form of saw-dusts, or raspings. Its use in fire-works may be
considered, 1st, as producing a particular coloured flame:
2dly, as varying the character of the flame, and likewise the
degree of the combustion; and 3dly, as communicating an
agreeable odour along with other substances; as in odoriferous
fire-works. To this, we may add its use in smoke-balls
along with nitre and sulphur.</p>

<p>The raspings of wood are sometimes required to be extremely
fine. This can only be done by employing sieves of
different degrees of fineness. They should be preserved from
the action of moisture.</p>

<p>In the composition of the new priming powder, of which
chlorate of potassa is the basis, very fine raspings of a particu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>lar
kind of wood are employed. So is also lycopodium for
the same purpose.</p>

<p>By the distillation of wood, as in the process of carbonization
in iron cylinders, we obtain some volatile products,
the chief of which is the pyroligneous, now called the pyroacetic
acid, while the ligneous fibre is converted into coal;
but, in the combustion of wood, all the volatile products are
expelled, some being consumed in the flame, and others,
with some carbon, condensed in the form of soot, while the
residue is an ash which furnishes common potash.</p>

<p>Ovid in his Metamorphoses, fable xvi, says&mdash;"Adomitis
Athamanis aquis accendere lignum narratur; minimos
cum luna recessit in orbes." This idea we know is groundless;
for it is impossible, that wood, sprinkled with water,
whether the waters of Athamanis, or any other, should be
kindled when the moon is in the decrease, or at any time of
the moon's age.</p>

<p>To prevent the action of fire on wood, marine salt, vitriol,
and alum have all been used. Various ways of employing
them have been adopted; but they do not absolutely prevent
wood taking fire in an active heat. For the same purpose,
(<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Coll. Academ.</cite> tome xi, p. 487,) a mixture of green vitriol,
and quicklime is recommended, by which we form sulphate
of lime and oxide of iron. The <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de Paris</cite> of 1781 contains
various processes. At Vienna, saline substances are
employed.</p>

<p>The combustion of wood is the same, in all cases, in
which oxygen is concerned; but the products in some particulars
may vary. Hence saw-dust, when mixed with nitrate
of potassa, and inflamed, will burn, and produce little
or no smoke, because the combustion is rapid and perfect;
but when employed with sulphur and nitre, it produces much
smoke. Here the oxygen is furnished by the nitre, and
carbonic acid gas is formed. The same thing takes place,
when a mixture of saw-dust and nitre is used in artificial
fire; and, according as the decomposition is more or less
rapid, the combustion will be so likewise. The particular
applications of saw-dust will be noticed hereafter.</p>

<p>With respect to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lycopodium</i> or puff ball and various species
of agaric, or the medullary excrescences of trees, which
are used in some preparations of artificial fire, we may observe,
that the first is confined principally to theatrical
fire-works, and the second to the preparation of spunk, or
tinder, called also pyrotechnical sponge. See <a href="#PYSx"><i>Pyrotechnical
Sponge</i>.</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the substance usually called <i>lightning wood</i>, found
in the hollow of the stumps of trees, and sometimes on the
surface, which, from having lost its compactness and other
characters of ligneous fibre, is called <i>rotten</i> wood, it is in
fact the solid part of the wood in a state of decomposition,
in consequence of which, it becomes a <i>solar phosphorus</i>. It
appears to owe its phosphorescent property, i. e. its power
of shining in the dark, to the previous absorption of light,
and not, as some have suggested, to the presence of phosphorus,
or the emission of any gaseous compound, which
contains it. The process of animal putrefaction will produce
such appearances, but, in this case, the cause is different.</p>

<p>Turf or peat, a substance found, and employed as fuel, in
some countries, and found in boggy situations, is partially
decomposed vegetable matter, consisting of a congeries of
fibres or roots. But black mould is the result of a decomposition
of vegetable substances, in which the ligneous
fibre is carbonized, and mixed with earth. The formation
of mould, however, is owing more to the decay of leaves
&amp;c. (See <a href="#COAx"><i>Coal</i>.</a>)</p>

<p>Dr. Shaw (<cite>Travels to the Holy Land</cite>) observes, that when
they were either to boil or bake, camel's dung was their common
fuel; which, after being exposed a day or two in the
sun, catches fire like touch-wood; and burns as light as
charcoal.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. L. Of Linseed Oil.</i></p>

<p>Linseed, or flaxseed, oil is obtained by expression from
flaxseed. It is a thick mucilaginous oil, when first extracted,
called <i>raw</i> oil, and in this state, is seldom used. The preparation,
it undergoes before it is used as drying oil for mixing
with paints, is nothing more than boiling it with litharge, or
some oxide of lead, which separates the mucilage, and unites
with the oil. By this treatment, it acquires the property of
drying with facility, when exposed to the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Linseed oil unites with great ease with oils, tallow, fat,
wax, &amp;c. Some of these compositions are used in fire-works.
A preparation of pitch, mutton suet, and linseed oil is used,
for instance, in preventing the access of moisture to fuses;
and in military fire-works, it is employed in combination
with pitch, rosin, mutton suet and turpentine for incendiary
works. Wax, and tallow, we may here add, are also used
in the preparations of similar works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. LI. Of Gum arabic, and Gum Tragacanth.</i></p>

<p>Gum arabic, which exudes from a tree that grows in
Egypt and Arabia (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mimosa nilotica</i>) when pure is transparent,
and nearly colourless. There are several varieties of this
gum; the <i>gum senegal</i>, for instance, which is of a reddish
colour, and occurs in larger pieces. Other mucilaginous
substances, the peach tree gum, the cherry tree gum, &amp;c.
which exist only in small quantities, are analogous to the
gum of the Mimosa.</p>

<p>Gum arabic is brittle, and for that reason may be easily
reduced to powder. It is readily dissolved in water, with
which it forms mucilage. In this state, it is employed in
fire-works, chiefly as a vehicle for the mixing of pastes,
matches, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Gum is a vegetable oxide, composed of carbon, hydrogen,
and oxygen. It does not crystallize. It is precipitated by some
metallic salts, as acetate of lead. It is insoluble in alcohol,
which distinguishes it from resins. Nitric acid decomposes
it, and changes it into the saclactic or mucous acid. With
sugar, the same acid produces oxalic acid.</p>

<p>Gum tragacanth, or gum dragon, is the produce of a thorny
shrub, which grows in Candia, and other islands of the
Levant, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">astragalus tragacantha</i>. The gum obtained
from this shrub has many properties in common with gum
arabic, and is, therefore, used as a paste. It dissolves readily
in boiling water; but is insoluble in alcohol, or ether.</p>

<p>It consists, almost entirely, of a peculiar vegetable principle,
which is called <i>cerasin</i> by Dr. John. Cerasin has the adhesive
qualities of gum arabic, but in a greater degree. It is
said to constitute a part of the gummy matter, that exudes
from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prunus cerasus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prunus avies</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prunus domestica</i>, &amp;c.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. LII. Of Cotton.</i></p>

<p>The soft down, which envelopes the seeds of different species
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gossypium</i>, or cotton plant, is the cotton of commerce.
These plants are natives of warm climates. Cotton when
bleached is perfectly white. It is extremely combustible, and
burns with a clear lively flame. The ashes left behind contain
potash.</p>

<p>Cotton is the substance, usually employed in making match
rope, for the communication of fire. It has also other uses
in pyrotechny. Cotton match is much used in fire-works for
exhibition, not only for single cases, but also for a series of
cases of artificial fire, either for fixed or moveable pieces; and
serves to communicate fire, either singly, or from one case to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
another, or to the whole piece at one time. Matches, so
used, are called leaders, and are generally confined in paper
tubes.</p>

<p>Cotton is one of the best applications to recent burns. Applied
to the part, it will, in a surprising manner, abate the
violence of the pain, and remove the inflammation.</p>

<p>Cotton is soluble in alkaline ley. For some of the earths,
it has a strong affinity, particularly alumina; as also for several
metallic oxides, and tannin. The action of mordants, in
dying of cotton-goods, depends on these affinities. Nitric
acid converts it into oxalic acid.</p>

<p>Cotton wick for lamps, candles, &amp;c. is rendered very inflammable
by spirit of turpentine. By dipping the end of the
wick in turpentine, the candle will inflame at once, the moment
flame is applied. For candle-making, the wick is
sometimes dipped in a solution of camphor in spirits, or in a
melted mixture of camphor and wax. See <a href="#CANx"><i>Candle</i>.</a></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. LIII. Of Bone and Ivory.</i></p>

<p>Bone, which is considered to be a combination of phosphate
of lime, gelatinous matter, animal oil, &amp;c. is used occasionally
in fire-works. By destructive distillation, bones,
or osseous matter, afford ammonia, Dippel's animal oil, &amp;c.;
and, when consumed by fire, leave a white ash, which is composed
principally of phosphate of lime. Bone-ash is the result
of the combustion of bone; for, while all the gelatinous
substance, oil, &amp;c. are burnt off, that, which composes
the basis of bone, and which distinguishes it from <i>gristle</i>,
remains in the form of ash. Bone-ash furnishes phosphorus
by a certain process. See <a href="#PHOx"><i>Phosphorus</i>.</a> Diluted muriatic
acid will take up the phosphate of lime of bone and leave
the gelatin. This mode is recommended for the separation
of gelatin from bone.</p>

<p>Bones, when carbonized in the same manner as wood,
furnish what is called <i>bone-black</i>, but commonly known by
the name of <i>ivory-black</i>. It is nothing more than animal
charcoal.</p>

<p>In Pyrotechny, bone, in the form of raspings, is employed
to communicate a <i>lustre</i> to the flame of gunpowder; but, for
this purpose, the most compact, and that, which contains the
least gelatin, is usually employed. Hence <i>ivory</i> is preferred.
Ivory, in the form of raspings, communicates to flame a
bright silver colour; and, on that account, is preferred to all
other kinds of bone. The compositions, into which it enters,
will be mentioned in a subsequent part of the work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Ivory is the tusk, or tooth of defence, of the male elephant,
and is an intermediate substance between bone and
horn, not capable of being softened by fire. The finest and
whitest ivory comes from the island of Ceylon. The
tooth of the sea-horse is said to approach to ivory, properly
so called. It is, however, harder, and, for that reason, preferred
by dentists for making artificial teeth. The coal of
ivory is remarkably black; but the so called ivory-black, sold
in the shops, is nothing else than bone-black.</p>

<p>Bone and ivory may be stained of various colours. One
hundred parts of ivory contain,</p>

lime, 10 lime, 1.1 phosphate of magnesia, 2 soda, and 2 carbonic
acid.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. LIV. Of Galbanum.</i></p>

<p>Galbanum is a gum-resin, obtained from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bubon galbanum</i>,
a plant peculiar to Africa. It is at first a juicy fluid,
which exudes when the plant is cut above the root, and hardens
by exposure to the air. Alcohol dissolves about three-fifths
of it. It contains some volatile oil.</p>

<p>The only instance we know of, in which galbanum has been
used in fire-works, is in the composition of rain-fire, employed
as an incendiary, before the present <i>fire-stones</i> were invented.
The rain-fire, which may be found in the fourth part
of this work, it is said, gave rise to the composition of fire-stone.
There is no advantage, however, in using galbanum for
this purpose; since pitch, tar, turpentine, and many other substances
are more inflammable, and, therefore, better adapted
for such compositions. We mention it merely because it
was one of the ingredients in that once celebrated incendiary
preparation, the fire-rain of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Siemenowitz'">Siemienowicz</ins>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. LV. Of Tow and Hemp.</i></p>

<p>In military fire-works, tow and hemp are much used, and
principally for the preparation of incendiary works. Both
tow and hemp are employed in forming match. Although
old rope, &amp;c. are used for immersion in the tourteaux, carcass,
or fire-stone composition, which is readily imbibed, if
the rope is untwisted and beaten; yet tow or hemp is a better
material, and receives more of the composition. The manner
of using it may be seen by referring to the composition
for fire-stone. For very nice purposes, the tow or hemp
should be well dressed. Flax is, therefore, to be preferred
in such cases.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. LVI. Of Blue Vitriol.</i></p>

<p>Different preparations of copper are used in fire-works, to
communicate colour to the flame; and besides copper filings,
brass filings, verdigris, and the oxides of copper, the sulphate
of copper, or blue vitriol, has been employed. We may
observe here, that there are three sub-species of this salt;
the bisulphate, sulphate, and sub-sulphate, the first properly
speaking being the blue vitriol of commerce.</p>

<p>The sulphate, although recommended in some of the old
formulæ for coloured fire, is not, however, preferable to some
other preparations of copper. The use and application of
copper, and its preparations, will be seen in the article on
coloured fire.</p>

<p>When sulphate of copper is heated, it is converted into a
bluish-white powder. If the heat be increased, the acid is
expelled, and the black oxide of copper remains. Before it
is used, it is exposed to heat to expel the water of crystallization.
It ought to be in the state of impalpable powder. It
is composed of 33 acid, 32 oxide, and 35 water. It is decomposed
by the alkalies and earths, the alkaline carbonates,
borates, and phosphates, and several metallic salts.</p>

<p>The oxide may be obtained very readily from this salt,
for the purpose of fire-works, by dissolving it in water, and
adding a solution of caustic potassa; collecting the precipitate,
and drying it in a moderate heat. This will expel the
water that may be contained in it; as metallic precipitates,
made in this way, are more or less in the state of hydrates.</p>

<p>When metallic copper is required, it may be obtained in
fine powder, and very expeditiously, by immersing a plate of
iron in a solution of any of the salts of copper, as the sul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>phate.
It will precipitate on the iron, and gradually fall to
the bottom of the vessel. This metallic copper will be found
to be much more impalpable than the filings, however fine,
and, for that reason, may be mixed more accurately with different
substances.</p>

<p>Copper burns with a beautiful green flame, and deposites
a loose greenish-gray oxide. The ammonia-oxalate of copper,
of which there are three sub-species, burns with flame.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. LVII. Of Nitrate of Copper.</i></p>

<p>This preparation of copper is used in some fire-works. It
communicates a green colour to flame. When combined with
carbonaceous substances, the combustion is vivid. This is owing
to the decomposition of the nitric acid, (in the same manner
as the acid of nitrate of potassa and other nitrates is decomposed),
during which carbonic acid and deutoxide of azote
are produced. Nitrate of copper has been more particularly
recommended for the preparation of match stick, similar to
that of M. Cadet, and of match rope. It is used in the
same manner as the nitrate of lead. M. Proust used it in
lieu of nitrate of lead when repeating some experiments of
M. Born. It is more expensive than the acetate, or even the
nitrate of lead. Its effect, however, is the same.</p>

<p>Nitrate of copper attracts the moisture of the atmosphere,
and deliquesces. Acetate of lead, on the contrary, by exposure
to the air gradually effloresces, and in time is decomposed.
The preparations of lead, for that reason, are preferable
to the nitrate of copper.</p>

<p>Nitrate of copper is formed by dissolving copper in nitric
acid; and, when the acid is saturated, the requisite quantity
of water may be added. The salt may be obtained in a dry
state by evaporation; and, after being dissolved in water, the
wood or rope may be soaked in it.</p>

<p>Dry nitrate of copper, wrapped up in tin-foil, will produce
no action; but, if water be added, sufficient to moisten it, and
then the foil closed tightly, combustion will take place. The
water promotes chemical action by dissolving the nitrate of
copper, which is then decomposed by the tin, and the quantity
of caloric, put in a distributable state, is sufficient to inflame
the tin. The details of the rationale will be given
hereafter.</p>

<p>The ammonia-nitrate of copper is fulminating copper.
The chlorate of copper is a deflagrating salt. Ammonia
added to nitrate of copper, first separates an oxide, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
dissolves it. It is more than probable, that nitrate of ammonia
causes the ammonia-nitrate to explode.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. LVIII. Of Strontia.</i></p>

<p>The earth called strontia or strontian, is found abundantly
in different parts of the world, in combination with carbonic
and sulphuric acids. The carbonate of strontia or strontianite,
effervesces with acids, and burns with a purple flame.
It contains about 60 or 70 per cent. of earth. The sulphate
of strontia, or celestine, contains about 57 of strontia.</p>

<p>When carbonate of strontia is mixed with charcoal powder,
and exposed to a heat of 140° of Wedgwood's pyrometer,
the carbonic acid will be expelled, and pure strontia
remain. The earth may be obtained in a pure state, by dissolving
the carbonate in nitric acid, and evaporating the solution
until it crystallizes, and exposing the crystals, in a
crucible, to a red heat, until the nitric acid is driven off. If
the carbonate cannot be had, the sulphate may be employed.
For this purpose, it is to be pulverized and mixed with an
equal weight of carbonate of potassa, and boiled in water.
The carbonate of strontia, thus obtained, which exists in the
form of a powder, is to be treated with nitric acid as already
described.</p>

<p>Strontia, like the other earths, is a compound body, having
a metallic basis, called <i>strontium</i>, which, united with
oxygen, forms the earth.</p>

<p>The specific gravity of strontia approaches that of barytes.
Like pure barytes, it is soluble in water, forming strontia
water. It requires rather more than 160 parts of water at
60° to dissolve it; but much less of boiling water.</p>

<p>The solution of strontia in water, when evaporated, will
crystallize in thin, transparent, quadrangular plates, generally
parallelograms, seldom exceeding a quarter of an inch
in length. These crystals contain about 68 per cent. of water;
and are soluble in little more than twice their weight of
boiling water, and in 54.4 times their weight of water at 60°.
When dissolved in alcohol, they give a blood-red colour
to its flame. The solution of strontia changes vegetable
blues to green. Strontia differs from barytes in being infusible,
much less soluble, of a different form, weaker in its
affinities, and not poisonous.</p>

<p>The metallic base of strontia, which was discovered by Sir
H. Davy, in 1808, when exposed to the air, or when thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
into water, rapidly absorbs oxygen, and is converted into
strontia.</p>

<p>As strontia communicates a red colour to flame, it has
been used in certain compositions of artificial fire. The brilliant
red fire, sometimes used in theatres, owes its colour to
this earth. See <a href="#THFx"><i>Theatrical fire-works</i>.</a> Muriate and nitrate
of strontia will give a red or purple colour to the flame of
alcohol. See <a href="#COLx"><i>coloured flame of alcohol</i>.</a></p>

<p>If a piece of cloth be dipped in a solution of muriate, nitrate,
or acetate of strontia, or in strontia water, and then
immersed in alcohol, it will burn with a red flame.</p>

<p>M. Fourcroy, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Système des Connaissances Chimiques, &amp;c.</cite>
tome iii,) mentions the use of nitrate and muriate of strontia,
in artificial fire-works, for the purpose of communicating a
red colour to the flame of combustible bodies. Since that
time, the nitrate, in particular, has been recommended and
used.</p>

<p>One of the characters of the salts of strontia, is, that they
give a red flame to burning bodies; whereas the salts of
barytes or of lime, used in the same manner, communicate
a yellow flame.</p>

<p>The saline combinations of strontia were examined with
particular attention by Dr. Hope. See <cite>Edinburg Philosoph.
Transactions</cite> for 1790.</p>

<p>Nitrate of strontia may be formed by dissolving carbonate
of strontia, or the sulphuret obtained by decomposing the
sulphate by charcoal, in nitric acid, filtering the solution,
evaporating it, and suffering it to crystallize.</p>

<p>Nitrate of strontia deflagrates on ignited coals. Dr. Hope
pointed out, that if nitrate of strontia be exposed to a red heat,
and a combustible substance be, at this time, brought in contact
with it, a deflagration, with a very vivid red flame, will
be produced. When a crystal of this salt is put into the wick
of a candle, it communicates a beautiful purple flame. It does
not deliquesce in the air, and, therefore, the compositions,
into which it enters, cannot spoil on that account. Nicholson
(<cite>Chemical Dictionary</cite>,) observes, that nitrate of strontia may
be used in the art of pyrotechny. For this purpose, however,
it is mixed with sulphur, chlorate of potassa, and sulphuret of
antimony; and sometimes with the addition of sulphuret of
arsenic and charcoal, as in the <i>red fire</i> for theatrical uses.</p>

<p>The muriate of strontia has similar properties. Davy first
observed, that when strontia was heated in chlorine gas, it
gave out oxygen gas, and a chloride of strontium was
formed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Muriate of strontia is formed very readily, by dissolving
the carbonate or sulphuret of strontia in muriatic acid,
and evaporating the solution in order to obtain crystals.
These crystals are very soluble in water. They are soluble,
also, in twenty-four times their weight of pure alcohol, at the
temperature of 60°. This alcoholic solution, we remarked,
burns with a fine purple colour. These crystals suffer no
change when exposed to the air, except they be very moist;
in which case, they deliquesce. When heated, they first undergo
the watery fusion, and are then reduced to a white
powder. Fourcroy recommends the muriate of strontia for
fire-works.</p>

<p>Carbonate of strontia, when thrown in powder on burning
coals, produces red sparks.</p>

<p>Acetate of strontia, another salt used in fire-works, is
formed by dissolving strontia, or its carbonate, in acetic
acid. It will crystallize. The crystals are not affected by
exposure to the air. When heated, its acid is decomposed,
as happens to all the other acetates.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. LIX. Of Boracic Acid.</i></p>

<p>Borate of soda, or borax, is a salt, which has long been
known, and is used chiefly in the arts as a flux for the fusion
of bodies, and for soldering. Boracic acid is a compound
body, consisting of a newly discovered substance, called boron,
and oxygen. Homberg obtained the acid from borax in
1702, by distilling a mixture of borax, and sulphate of iron.
He supposed that it was a product of the latter; and hence it
was called the <i>volatile narcotic salt of vitriol</i>, or <i>sedative
salt</i>.</p>

<p>Boracic acid forms two salts with soda; the borate, properly
so called, and borax. It is supposed to be our borax,
that Pliny mentions under the name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crysocolla</i>, so called by
the ancients. Others, however, assert, that their crysocolla
was nothing more than the rust of copper, triturated with
urine. The impure borax in the East Indies, is called <i>tincal</i>.
When borax is melted, and exposed for some time to
heat, it loses its water, and is changed into what is known by
the name of <i>calcined borax</i>.</p>

<p>The easiest process for obtaining boracic acid is to make
a concentrated solution of borax in hot water, and add by degrees,
sulphuric acid, which will unite with the soda; and, as
the fluid cools, the boracic acid will separate in shining laminated
crystals. No more acid should be added than is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
sufficient to make the solution slightly sour. The crystals
are to be washed with cold water, and drained upon brown
paper.</p>

<p>One of the principal characters of boracic acid is, that it
is very soluble in alcohol, to the flame of which it communicates
a green colour. Paper dipped in this solution, burns
in the same manner.</p>

<p>In consequence of this property of imparting a green colour
to flame, I made some experiments with it, for the purpose
of preparing <i>green fire</i>; and found, that, by employing
it in the proportion of one-eighth, the flame was always
green, provided that the flame of the combustible used, was
not tinged of any other colour. Nitre, charcoal, and boracic
acid will give a green; also nitre, lamp oil, and boracic
acid; nitre, alcohol, and boracic acid, along with charcoal;
and chlorate of potassa, charcoal, and boracic acid, with or
without the addition of alcohol. But, although boracic acid
communicates a lively green, its expense will prevent its use
in that way, especially as many other preparations, as those
of copper, will have the same effect, and are more economical
on account of their price. See the <a href="#COLx"><i>Coloured Flame of Alcohol,
and Coloured Fire</i>.</a></p>

<p>Oils, when assisted by heat, will dissolve boracic acid. In
naphtha, it is very soluble. With oils, it yields fluid and solid
products, which give a green colour to the flame of alcohol.
It is not a combustible acid, but only imparts colour
to the flame of combustible bodies.</p>

<p>Boron will unite with fluorine, the radical of fluoric acid.
When one part of vitrified boracic acid, two of fluate of
lime or fluor spar, and twelve of sulphuric acid are distilled,
an acid gas will be obtained, called fluo-boric gas. For the
properties of boron, consult Thenard's <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de Chimie</cite>.</p>

<p class="center">OF THE LABORATORY.</p>


<p>The laboratory for pyrotechny may consist of a building,
furnished with furnaces, boilers, &amp;c. for the preparation or
refining of saltpetre, and other substances for use; but according
to its present acceptation, it is a place where all
kinds of fire-works are prepared, both for actual service and
for exhibition; such as, besides the ordinary works for show,
quick matches, fuses, port-fire, grape-shot, case-shot, carcasses,
hand granades, cartridges, &amp;c. It should have tables,
benches, and closets, where the tools, paper, thread, &amp;c. may
be commodiously placed, and an adjoining room to contain a
supply of materials for two days' work.</p>

<p>The chief artificer takes the weight of the materials made
use of, attends to the weighing of the different substances, and
sees that the mixtures are made properly, &amp;c. He also keeps
an account of the number and kinds of fire-works. The prepared
fire-works ought to be removed daily to the magazine.
If they are made up in the field, under a tent, (denominated
the <i>Laboratory tent</i>,) they should be packed in barrels or in
caissons.</p>

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. II. Of Mandrils and Cylinders for forming Cartridges
and Cases.</i></p>

<p>The rollers or rods, on which cartridges are formed, ought
to be solid, and perfectly straight and round. Very dry,
sound wood should be selected, and when turned, the rod
should be perfectly cylindrical; one extremity being concave,
and the other convex.</p>

<p>Mandrils may be made of copper, which is preferable to
wood, as this is apt to warp and crack; and in both cases,
should be longer than the cartridge, so as to be drawn out
easily. They are of different lengths and diameters, according
to their respective uses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="RAMx" id="RAMx"></a><i>Sec. III. Of Rammers, Chargers, and Mallets.</i></p>

<p>The rammers which are used for compression, are cylindrical
like the preceding. They have a head much larger
in dimensions than the part that enters the tube. (See A, B,
C, D, and E of Fig. 1. in <a href="#PLAx">the Plate</a>). Besides being made
of wood, which should be of the hardest kind, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lignum vitæ</i>,
they may be formed of copper or brass. In this case, they
are first cast of the requisite size and shape, and finished in
a lathe. Wooden heads are sometimes put to them, but
with little advantage; as they frequently split and require to
be renewed.</p>

<p>The wooden rammer may be struck with metal; but when
the rammer is of copper or brass, wooden mallets must be
always employed.</p>

<p>We may here remark, that in charging rockets, it has
been customary to employ several rammers. The first <i>drift</i>
must be six diameters from the handle, and this, as well as
all other rammers, ought to be a little thinner than the former,
to prevent the tearing of the paper, when the charge is
driven in. In the end of this rammer is a hole to fit over
the piercer. (See <a href="#PLAx">B. Fig. 1.</a>) The line marked on this
rammer, as will be explained hereafter, when it appears at
the top of the case, indicates that a second rammer must be
used. This second rammer, from the handle, is four diameters,
having a hole for the piercer, 1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> diameters long. (C.
Fig. 1.) When the case is filled as high as the top of the
piercer, a short and solid drift is used. (E. Fig. 1.).</p>

<p>Rammers must have a ferrule, or collar of brass at the
bottom, to keep the wood from spreading, or splitting. With
regard to the handles of the rammers, if their diameter be
equal to the bore of the mould, and two diameters long, the
proportion is a good one. The shorter they can be used, the
better. The longer the drift, the less of course, will be the
pressure on the composition, by the blow given by the mallet.</p>

<p>We may observe here, that rockets may either be driven
over a piercer, or driven solid, and afterwards bored.</p>

<p>As much of the effect of rockets depends upon the manner
they are driven, whether lightly or compactly, or uniformly
throughout, circumstances which affect their quality; it is
necessary, in using the rammer, to employ an equal force
for driving the composition. The mallet, therefore, should
be of a given weight; and a certain number of strokes with
the same force, on each new charge, must be accurately fol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>lowed,
until the driving is completed; taking care, at the
same time, that the rocket stands firm on a solid body.</p>

<p>Dry beech is the best wood for mallets. A writer very
judiciously observes, in the <cite>Encyclopedia <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Britanica'">Britannica</ins></cite>, (vol. xv,
695), that, if a person uses a mallet of a moderate size, in
proportion to the rocket, according to his judgment, and if
the rocket succeeds, he may depend on the rest, by <i>using the
same mallet</i>; yet it will be necessary, that cases of different
sorts, be driven with mallets of different sizes. In all cases,
under one ounce, the charge may be rammed with an ounce
mallet.</p>

<p>There is an advantage, also, by having the handle of the
mallet turned out of the same piece as the head, and made
in a cylindrical form. If their dimensions are regulated
by the diameters of the rockets; then, for example, if the
thickness of the head be three diameters, and its length four,
the length of the handle will be five diameters, whose thickness
must be in proportion to the hand.</p>

<p>Bigot (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Artifice de Guerre</cite>, p. 118) speaking of the flying
fuses, or sky-rockets, observes, that the mallet used for driving
the composition, is proportionably large, according to
the rockets, and that it is five inches in length, and four in
breadth, when the diameter of the rocket is from 12 to 18
lines. The mallets for larger rockets are stronger and heavier,
and, in some instances, where a great force is required, as in
driving war-rockets, a machine similar to the pile-engine, is
used. See <a href="#CROx"><i>Congreve Rockets</i>.</a></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. IV. Of Utensils necessary for constructing of Signal
Rockets.</i></p>

<p>A detailed account of the tools used in making signal
rockets, may be seen in Ruggeri, <cite>Pyrotechny</cite>, p. 143; but
M. Bigot has enumerated them as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>One mandril for forming the cartridge, or case.</li>
<li>One pair of curved compasses to determine the exterior diameter.</li>
<li>Three conical mandrils. (See <a href="#PLAx">fig. 3, plate.</a>)</li>
<li>One solid, or massive cylinder.</li>
<li>One mould for garnishing.</li>
<li>Two moulds for the capitals, or heads, one of which is for the rockets with, and the other for the rockets without, the <i>garnish</i>, or furniture.</li>
<li>One piercer and block (See <a href="#PLAx">plate, fig. 1, I &amp; H.</a>)</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
One scoop.</li>
<li>One punch.</li>
<li>One mallet.</li>
<li>One press.</li>
<li>One large knife.</li>
<li>One pair of scissors.</li>
</ul>

<p>All the wooden utensils ought to be made of hard and
sound wood, without knots. The rammers should be furnished
with rings or ferrules, and the first bored with a hole
of sufficient length to receive the piercer. The second should
be bored deep enough to receive two-thirds of the piercer,
and the third, to receive one-third, while the fourth should
be solid. These rammers are all furnished with heads. (See
<a href="#RAMx">section iii.</a>)</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. V. Of the Rolling, or Plane Board.</i></p>

<p>This board is furnished with a handle, and is used for
rolling rocket cases, &amp;c. and is of different dimensions, according
to its application. It is made of hard wood, such as
oak or walnut.</p>

<p>When the paper is wrapped round the mandril or <i>former</i>,
the rolling board is used to compress the paper, and make it
round and smooth.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VI. Of the Driver for charging large Rockets.</i></p>

<p>This contrivance is similar to a pile driver in construction;
and, by means of a weight falling upon the rammer,
the charge is sent home with great force. Its use is confined
to the largest kind of rockets.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VII. Of Mortars and Pestles.</i></p>

<p>Mortars are employed for the pulverization of substances,
and, according to their use, may be either of wood, marble,
brass, or cast-iron, which last costs less than the others.
Large mortars have covers, in order to confine the finer particles.
The pestles should be of very hard wood; because,
in that case, no danger would be apprehended of an explosion
of the materials, an occurrence which might take place, if
iron were used. This, however, depends on the substances
submitted to the pestle.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VIII. Of the Choaker or Strangler.</i></p>

<p>The choaker is nothing more than a contrivance, usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
made of rope, by which the closing of the end of the rocket
is effected, so as to form a kind of cup or mouth.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. IX. Of the Table and Sack for mealing Gunpowder.</i></p>

<p>This table may be either square or an octagon, and made of
hard wood. There is a rim, a few inches high, raised round
it, and a gutter at one end to allow the powder to pass out,
when the operation is finished. <a href="#PLAx">See plate, fig. 7 and 8.</a></p>

<p>This mode of mealing powder is by no means to be preferred.
(See <a href="#GUNx"><i>Gunpowder</i>.</a>)</p>

<p>A sack is also used for crushing powder. It should be
made of strong elastic leather, and sewed together in such a
manner as to prevent the impalpable powder from passing
through its seams. They are of an oblong shape, and contain
from 20 to 25 pounds. Fifteen pounds are generally
put in at a time. This method of crushing powder is preferred,
as it is less liable to accidents. It is hardly necessary
to add, that the bag is beaten with a cylindrical stick.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. X. Of Sieves.</i></p>

<p>There are several kinds of sieve. The common sieve
has neither a cover nor a receiver, and may be either formed
of horse hair, or of brass or copper wire. It is necessary
to have some sieves of a finer kind. For this purpose, silk
and gauze are generally used. The cover is merely leather,
fixed in a frame, which fits on the top. The receiver is
formed nearly in the same manner, having a skin stretched
over a frame, which fits on the under part of the sieve.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XI. Of the Paper Press.</i></p>

<p>A press, for the purpose of pressing paper, is formed of
two pieces of wood, which are brought together by means
of one, or several screws. This press is sometimes, though
seldom, used. If <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'paste-board'">pasteboard</ins> is made, when it cannot be
had ready prepared, then the press is actually necessary.
The intention is to unite the several sheets, which have been
pasted, by using the pressure of the screw, and to remove any
extraneous paste, so that the paper may have no inequalities
on its surface. In lieu of the screw-press, heavy weights
laid on the paper for several hours, will answer the same
purpose.</p>

<p class="negidt1"><i>Preliminary operations in the preparation of fire-works, and
observations on the preservation of gunpowder, and sundry
manipulations.</i></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. I. Of the Workshop.</i></p>

<p>We have already noticed the principal furniture of a laboratory,
and, therefore, can add nothing new on this head.
There are, however, some utensils employed for particular
works, which we may here describe.</p>

<p>In the disposition of the workshop, the tables, utensils, &amp;c.
are arranged, according as the judgment may dictate for
convenience and use. Care must be taken to prevent the access
of fire, and to prevent, as far as possible, the presence
of moisture. Lanterns, if light is required, are always to
be preferred; but the best manner of communicating light is
through a window, placing the lights outside of the building,
or apartment, as is done in powder mills. Other precautions
may be necessary, which will readily suggest themselves.</p>

<p>In conducting the work, the workmen are to be so arranged,
as that, while some are employed in the preliminary operations,
others are making and finishing the preparations.
The compositions may be ready prepared, and well preserved
in jars or other vessels. This is named by the French,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cabinet de composition</i>. It is a place, also, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'whe r'">where</ins> the substances
are weighed, and mixed.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="MAGx" id="MAGx"></a><i>Sec. II. Of the Magazine.</i></p>

<p>The magazine is a place of deposite for gunpowder, to
preserve it from fire, and moisture. We have already mentioned
the preservation of gunpowder in the article on that
subject; but it may not be improper to offer some remarks,
respecting the construction of magazines.</p>

<p>Authors differ in opinion, both in regard to their situation
and construction; but they all agree, that they ought to be
arched, and bomb-proof. The first powder magazines were
made with gothic arches: Vauban constructed them in a
semicircular form, to make them stronger. Their dimensions
were, sixty feet long, within, and twenty-five broad. The
foundations were eight or nine feet thick, and eight feet high,
to the spring of the arch. The floors were two feet from the
ground, for the purpose of keeping the magazine free from
dampness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>It is observed, that the centres of semicircular arches will
settle at the crown, and their sinking must break the cement.
A remedy was applied for this inconvenience, by the <i>arch of
equilibration</i>, as described in Hutton's work on bridges. As,
in powder magazines, the ill effect of the breaking of the
cement is particularly felt, Mr. Hutton proposed to find an
arch of equilibration for them in particular, and to construct
it, when the span is twenty feet, the pitch or height, ten, (which
are the same dimensions as the semicircle), the inclined exterior
walls at top, forming an angle of 113 degrees, and the
height of their angular point, above the top of the arch, equal
to seven feet.</p>

<p>A wall built round a magazine, gives it an additional security.
The roof should be slated, or covered with lead or
copper, and it ought to be furnished with a lightning rod,
placed ten or fifteen yards from the building. The points of
the rods may be either gilt, or of solid gold. Silver, however,
is generally used; but, above all, platinum is to be preferred.
The advantage of these points is, that they do not
rust like iron, or become oxidized, an occurrence which
would diminish their powers as conductors of the electric
fluid.</p>

<p>To prevent the access of moisture, or rather to absorb it,
some have recommended the inner walls to be covered with
a composition of powdered coal, &amp;c. Lining of magazines
with sheet lead, appears to have some advantages.</p>

<p>St. <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Peirre'">Pierre</ins> observes, that a Prussian officer informed him,
that, having remarked that vapour was attracted by lead, he
had employed it for drying the atmosphere of a powder magazine,
constructed under ground, in the throat of a bastion,
rendered useless from its humidity. He ordered the concave
ceiling of the arch to be lined with lead, where the gunpowder
was deposited in barrels: the vapour of the wall collected
in drops on the leaden roof, ran off, and left the gunpowder
barrels perfectly dry.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. III. Of the Driving or Ramming of Sky-rockets.</i></p>

<p>We purpose in the present article to give some general directions
for the driving of rockets.</p>

<p>Rockets may be driven solid, or over a piercer. In the
latter case, they must not have so much composition put in
them at a time. The piercer, accompanying a greater part
of the bore of the case, would cause the rammer to rise too
high; so that the pressure of it would not be so great on the
composition, nor would it be driven equally. For rockets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
rammed over a piercer, let the ladle, or copper scoop, hold
as much composition, as, when driven, will raise the drift one-half
the interior diameter of the case; and, for those driven
solid, let it contain as much as will raise the drift one-half
the exterior diameter of the case. Ladles are generally
made to go easily into the case, and the length of the scoop
is about one and a half of its own diameter.</p>

<p>The charge of rockets must always be driven one diameter
above the piercer, and, on it, must be rammed, one-third
of a diameter of clay; through the middle of which a small
hole must be bored to the composition, so that, when the
charge is burnt to the top, it may communicate its fire,
through the hole, to the stars in the head. (See <a href="#PLAx">plate, fig. 14.</a>)
Great care must be taken to strike, with the mallet, with an
equal force, giving the same number of strokes to each ladleful
of composition; otherwise the rocket will not rise with
a uniform motion, or burn equally and regularly, for which
reason, they cannot carry a proper tail. It will break, in this
case, before the rocket has ascended to its extreme height,
where the rocket should break and disperse the stars, rain, or
whatever is contained in the head. When in the act of ramming,
the drift or driver must be kept constantly turning or
moving; and when the hollow rammers are used, the composition
is to be knocked out every now and then, or the
piercer will split them. To a rocket of four ounces, give to
each ladleful of charge, 16 strokes; to a rocket of 1 lb. 28;
to a 2 pounder, 36; to a 4 pounder, 42; to a 6 pounder, 56.
But rockets of a larger sort cannot be driven by hand, and
must be rammed with a machine similar to a pile-driver.</p>

<p>The method of ramming wheel cases, or any other sort,
in which the charge is driven solid, is much the same as that
used for sky-rockets; for the same proportion may be observed
in the ladle, and the same number of strokes given,
according to their diameters, all cases being distinguished by
their diameters. In this manner, a case, whose bore is equal
to that of a rocket of four ounces, is called a four ounce
case; and one which is equal, in bore, to an eight ounce rocket,
an eight ounce case, &amp;c. The method of ramming cases,
without moulds, will answer for strong pasted cases, and save
the expense of making so many moulds. In filling any case, it
must be placed on a perpendicular block of wood, in order to
keep it firm and solid; otherwise the composition would be
rammed unequally.</p>

<p>When cases are to be filled without moulds, procure some
nipples, made of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'bass'">brass</ins> or iron, in proportion to the cases, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
screw or fix in the top of the driving block. When the
nipple is fixed in, make, at about one and half inches from
it, a square hole in the block, six inches deep, and one inch
in diameter. Then have a piece of wood, six inches longer
than the case intended to be filled, and two inches square.
On one side of it, cut a groove, almost the length of the
case, whose breadth and depth must be sufficient to cover
near one-half the case. Then cut the other end, to fit the
hole in the block; but take care to cut it, so that the groove
may be at a proper distance from the nipple. This half
mould being made, and fixed tight in the block, cut, in another
piece of wood, nearly of the same length as the case,
a groove of the same dimensions as that in the fixed piece.
Then put the case on the nipple, and, with the cord, tie it,
and the two half moulds together; and the case will be prepared
for filling. The dimensions of the above half moulds
are proportionable for cases of eight ounces; but they differ
in size in proportion to the cases.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. IV. Of the Boring of Rockets.</i></p>

<p>The machine, for boring rockets, is similar, in some respects,
to a lathe. The rocket is confined in a box, and, by
means of a wheel, which is made to turn a second one, an
auger rammer is put in motion. The rammer must be of a
size, proportionate to the rocket, and of the same diameter,
as the top of the bore intended, and continue of that thickness,
a little longer than the depth of the bore required. The
thick end of each <i>rammer</i> must be made square, and all of
the same size. The rammer is made to move backward, and
forward, so that, after the rammer is marked three and a
half diameters of the rocket, from the point, set the guide,
allowing for the thickness of the front of the rocket box,
and the neck and mouth of the rocket. When the rocket is
fixed in the box, it must be pushed forward against the rammer,
and, when the scoop of the rammer is full, draw the
box back, and knock out the composition. A little oil is
sometimes used, to prevent the friction from setting fire to
the rocket. Having bored a number of rockets, taps must
be used. These taps are similar to the common spicket.
When employed, it is necessary to mark them three and a
half diameters from the point, allowing for the thickness of
the rocket's neck.</p>

<p>There are several contrivances for the boring of rockets.
The operation is sometimes done, by confining the rocket in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
a box, and boring it with a borer, fixed in a brace, using, at
the same time, a proper director. This brace is like the
common <i>brace</i>, used by carpenters, or formed on that principle,
and made of iron. The motion, given by the hand,
performs the operation.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. V. Of the Preservation of Steel or Iron Filings.</i></p>

<p>When treating of iron, we mentioned, that it has the property
of oxidizing rapidly, when exposed to the air and
moisture; and that its effects in fire-works, in that case,
would be either destroyed, or considerably diminished. And
even fire-works, in which iron enters as a component part,
will, if kept long, lose some of their effect, in consequence
of the change, which the iron suffers; for, instead of producing
brilliant sparks, which is their intention, it would impart
a dull red appearance.</p>

<p>Two methods are recommended for the preservation of
iron. The one is to melt a portion of sulphur, and throw
the filings into it, and afterwards to separate the extraneous
sulphur. The other consists in wrapping them up in oiled
paper. As to the first method, we may apprehend the effect
of the sulphur, combining with some of the iron, instead of
coating it, forming thereby a sulphuret, which, besides, is readily
decomposed by the contact of air and moisture, producing
sulphate of iron. The second method, of wrapping them in
oil, or, in fact, covering them with oil, is certainly a greater
preventive from rust, for where the oil is in contact, no oxidizement
can take place.</p>

<p>There are several methods recommended to preserve iron-work
from rusting. The use of paint and varnish for this
purpose is familiar. In Sweden, they cover iron-work with
a mixture of pitch, tar, and wood soot, which acquires a
gloss, similar to that of varnish, and is said to prevent the
oxidizement of the metal very effectually. Fat-oil varnish,
mixed with four-fifths of rectified spirit of turpentine, has
been recommended. It is applied with a brush, or sponge.
Articles, varnished with this preparation, are said to retain
their metallic brilliancy, and never contract any spots of rust.
Another composition, for the same purpose, is highly recommended.
It consists in applying a mixture of one pound of
hogs' lard, free from salt, one ounce of camphor, two drachms
of black lead in powder, and two drachms of dragon's blood.
At Sheffield and Birmingham, sundry articles, made of steel
and iron, are preserved from rust, when sent to foreign mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>kets,
by wrapping them in coarse brown paper, prepared first
with oil.</p>

<p>Among the different preparations, recommended at various
times to prevent iron from contracting rust, we may mention
one, which has been used with success, and which gives a
lead colour. It is nothing more than taking some litharge,
and heating it in an iron pot, and scattering over it some sulphur.
The litharge will change its colour, forming a kind of
sulphuret of lead, which is then ground with drying oil, and
applied like paint. We are told, that this preparation gets
remarkably hard, and resists the weather more effectually than
any other lead colour.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VI. Of the making of Wheels and other Works incombustible.</i></p>

<p>It is usual to give a coat of paint to the wood-work of
wheels, &amp;c. which are designed to carry a number of cases.
To prevent their taking fire, paint, in some measure, has the
effect. The following composition is recommended: Take
brick dust, coal-ashes, and iron filings, of each an equal
quantity, and mix them with a double size, made hot. Apply
this to the wood, and when dry, give it another coat.</p>

<p>Several methods have been adopted for the same purpose;
but wood may be made to resist, in a great degree, the action
of fire, and rendered almost incombustible, by soaking it in
a solution of the supersulphate of potassa and alumina,
(alum), in sulphate of iron, (green vitriol), and in other salts,
which are incombustible.</p>

<p>With respect to the use of alum as a preservative against
fire, it is certain, that, although its use in this way is very
ancient, it was not often recommended; for writers on the
art of war, such, for example, as Anas, mentions the use of
vinegar, in the following quotation from his <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Poliorcet.</cite> cap.
24: "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Majus juverit, si prius ligna aceto linantur; nam a
materia aceto illita, ignis abstinet</span>."</p>

<p>The use of alum, to prevent substances from taking fire,
is not a new invention; notwithstanding we find it recommended
in modern works, not only for wood, but also for
paper, and linen and cotton dresses, &amp;c. Aulus Gellius relates,
that Archelaus, one of the generals of Mithridates,
washed over a wooden tower with a solution of alum, and
thereby rendered it so much proof against fire, that all Sylla's
attempts to set it in flames proved abortive.</p>

<p>A writer in the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthologia Hibernica</cite>, vol. iii, for 1794,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
observes, that the use of alum to prevent the action of fire,
on wood, or other combustible bodies, is not new, and those,
who lay claim, are not entitled to originality on that head.</p>

<p>Another mode to prevent wood from taking fire may also
be adopted. It consists in mixing together, one ounce of
sulphur, one ounce of red ochre, and six ounces of green
vitriol. The wood work is covered with joiners' glue, and
the mixture is then put over it. This process is to be repeated
three or four times, allowing the glue to dry before a
new coat is applied.</p>

<p>There are several other preparations for the same purpose,
not only for the covering of wood, but also paper.
But M. Ruggeri is of opinion, that they cannot be depended
upon, when used on paper; for the paper will, in part, be
consumed. The formula for one of these compositions, is
thus given by that gentleman: To a pound of flour, mix
a handful of powdered alum, and add to it strong glue-water,
and bring it to a proper consistence with clay. Flour and
glue-water, mixed together, with the addition of a small
quantity of muriate of soda, (common salt), is also recommended
for the same purpose. Wood, steeped in a solution
of common salt, so as to be thoroughly impregnated with it,
is very difficult of combustion. In Persia, salt is used to prevent
timber from the attack of worms. The practice of <i>salting</i>
ship timber is highly recommended.</p>

<p>Wood, in fact, may be rendered incombustible by several
processes, some of which we have given. Earl Stanhope,
among others, made some interesting experiments on this
subject.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Having thus given some of the modes, usually adopted to
render wood incombustible, or to prevent its taking fire
so instantaneously, we purpose to add some remarks <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'repecting'">respecting</ins>
the processes for colouring it. An excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
preservation against moisture, which communicates a colour
at the same time, is formed of 12 lbs of rosin, 3 lbs of sulphur,
and 12 pints of whale oil, melted and mixed with
a sufficient quantity of red or yellow ochre, and applied by
means of a brush. Pulverized black lead may be substituted
for the ochre. Several coats of this mixture may be put on,
allowing each coat to dry before another is applied. This
composition is particularly well adapted for wheel work, &amp;c.
and for aquatic fire-works. Chaptal advises, for the same
purpose, a mixture of equal parts of white turpentine, bees'
wax, and maltha, or, in the place of maltha, coal tar. Wood,
covered with three coats of this composition, and immersed
for two years in water, was found to be quite dry. It would
be well, however, to cover it with some of the preparation,
to render wood incombustible.</p>

<p>With respect to the staining of wood of various colours,
several preparations may be used. To communicate a green
colour, a hot solution of acetate of copper may be used; or
verdigris, alum, and vinegar, boiled together. A decoction
of brazil wood, with alum and cream of tartar, will impart
a red; indigo, dissolved in sulphuric acid, (liquid blue
dye), a blue; a decoction of logwood, nut-galls, and copperas,
a black; a solution of dragon's blood, or of alkanet wood, in
turpentine, a mahogany colour, &amp;c. The imitation of bronze
on wood may be effected, by covering it first with isinglass
size, then suffering it to dry, and putting on a coat of oil
gold size, and covering it with bronze powder, a preparation
sold for that purpose. A solution of aloes in spirits, which
communicates a greenish-black, is a great preservative of
wood against worms.</p>

<p>M. Ollivier (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives des Découvertes</cite>, v, p. 386) has given
a variety of recipes for imitating bronze, stone, &amp;c. He
recommends the following for the imitation of ancient
bronze, which may be applied to wood-work. Melt together
150 lbs of fine sand, 170 lbs of lead ore, (Galena), and 30 lbs
of manganese, and add one-sixth part of brass. This compound
is then pulverized. It is applied on the usual ground.</p>

<p><i>Black earth</i>, as it is called, made of green earth, oxide of
manganese, oxide of iron, and oxide of copper, is also recommended
for covering wood-work. The composition for <i>imitation
marble</i>, is 1 part of green earth, <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> a part of sand, and
<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>th of a part of bol. armen. By adding <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>14</sub></span>th part of
<i>yellow burnt copper</i>, the colour will approach to green. The
same composition, with <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span>th part of copper, and <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>32</sub></span>d
iron, will give a black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VII. Of the formation of Rocket, and other Cases.</i></p>

<p>The cases for rockets, as a general rule, are to be made
6<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> times their exterior diameter in length; and all other
cases, that are to be filled in moulds, must be as long as the
moulds, within a half of the interior diameter. Rocket cases,
from the smallest, to 4 or 6 pounds, are generally made
of the strongest sort of cartridge paper, and rolled dry; but
the large sort are made of pasted pasteboard. (See <a href="#PASx">observations
on that subject.</a>) As it is very difficult to roll the ends
of the cases quite even, the best way is to keep a pattern of
the paper for the different kinds of cases. These patterns
should be longer than the case they are designed for, and the
number of sheets required should be marked, which will
prevent any paper being cut to waste. Cut the paper of a
proper size, and the last sheet for each case, with a slope at
one end; so that when the cases are rolled, it may form a
spiral line round the outside; and that this slope may always
be the same, let the pattern be so formed for a constant
guide. Before you begin to roll, fold down one end of the
first sheet so far, as that the fold will go two or three times
round the former; then, in the double edge, lay the former
with its handle off the table, and after rolling two or three
turns, lay the next sheet on that which is loose, and roll it
all on.</p>

<p>The smoothing board, which is about twenty inches long,
is now to be applied; and after rolling the paper three or four
times, lay on, in the same manner, another sheet of paper,
and smooth it in the same manner. This operation is to be
repeated till the case is sufficiently thick. When the last sheet
is rolled, we must observe, that the point of the slope is
placed at the small end of the roller.</p>

<p>The case being made, the small end of the former is put
in, to about one diameter of the end of the case, and the end
piece is inserted within a little distance of the former.
Then give the pinching cord one turn round the case, between
the former and the end piece. At first, pull easy, and
keep moving the case, which will make the neck smooth, and
without large wrinkles. This operation is called by the
French <i>strangling</i>, or <i>choaking</i>. When the cases are hard to
choak, let each sheet of paper (except the first and last in
that part where the neck is formed) be a little moistened with
water. Immediately after you have struck the concave
stroke, bind the neck of the case round with small twine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
which must not be tied in a knot, but fastened with two or
three hitches.</p>

<p>Having thus pinched and tied the case, so as not to give
way, put it into the mould without its foot, and, with a small
mallet, drive the former hard on the end piece, which will
force the neck close and smooth. When this is done, cut the
case to its proper length, allowing, from the neck to the edge
of the mouth, half a diameter, which is equal to the height
of the nipple. Then take out the former, and drive the case
over the piercer with the long rammer, and the vent will be
of a proper size.</p>

<p>Wheel cases are sometimes driven on a nipple, with a
point to close the neck, and make the vent of the size required;
which, in most cases, is generally <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>th of their interior
diameter. As it is very often difficult, when the cases
are rolled, to draw the roller out, a hole must be made in its
handle, and a pin, as a purchase, put in.</p>

<p>The machine for pinching cases consists of a treadle,
which, when pressed hard with the foot, will act upon a cord,
and draw it tight. The cord runs over a small pulley, and is
fixed to an upright piece. It is wound once round the case,
between the former and end piece; and when the cord is
drawn, the case is brought together.</p>

<p>Cases are commonly rolled wet for wheels and fixed pieces;
and when they are required to contain a great length of
charge, the method of making these cases is thus: The paper
must be cut as usual, except the last, which ought not to
have a slope. Having it ready, paste each sheet on one side,
and then fold down the first sheet as before directed; but be
careful that the paste does not touch the upper side of the
fold. If the roller be wetted, it will tear the paper in drawing
it out. In pasting the last sheet, observe not to wet the
last turn or two in that part where it is to be pinched; for if
that part be damp, the pinching cord will stick to it, and tear
the paper. Therefore, in choaking those cases, roll a bit of
dry paper once round the case, before the pinching cord is
used. This paper is to be taken off after the operation. The
rolling board, and all other methods, according to the former
directions for the rolling and pinching of cases, must be used
for these, as well as other cases. See <cite>Encyclopedia <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Britanica'">Britannica</ins></cite>,
vol. xv, p. 692.</p>

<p>Morel, in a practical work, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité Practique des Feux
d'Artifice</cite>) speaking of rocket cases, observes, that the rule is,
to give to their thickness, half the interior diameter, or half
the diameter of the roller. If the roller, for instance, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
half an inch, the case should be <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>th of an inch in thickness.
A rocket is divided into three equal parts; two for the interior
diameter, and one for the thickness of the case.</p>

<p>As to the length of sky-rockets, it is regulated by the
length of the piercer, if they are pierced in the charging.
One-third more than this length is allowed for the <i>choak</i>, and
the rest, of course, for the composition. With respect to
other cases, Morel remarks, that the cases for turning pieces
are usually six inches in length, and, for fixed pieces, seven
and eight inches. The cases of <i>Roman candles</i>, are of
the same thickness as those of rockets. In length they are, as
well as the <i>Mosaic candle</i>, fifteen inches. They are choaked
and cut.</p>

<p>Those of <i>serpents</i> are made with one or two cards, which
are rolled upon a former of wood, or metal, <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>th of an inch
in diameter, and four inches in length. When made, the
case measures three inches. Dry rolling is considered sufficient
for these cases.</p>

<p>The <i>fixed stars</i> are made of common pasteboard, 3<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>
inches long, on a mandril, <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> an inch in diameter. They
are pasted with ordinary paste, but mixed with clay, and
choaked, and bound as usual.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="TOUy" id="TOUy"></a><i>Sec. VIII. Of Tourbillon Cases.</i></p>

<p>This kind of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'cases is'">case is</ins> generally made 8 diameters long;
but, if very large, seven will be sufficient. From four ounces
to two pounds, will succeed perfectly, but, when larger,
there is no certainty. They are best rolled wet with
paste, and the last sheet must have a straight edge, so that
the case may be all of a thickness. After rolling them in the
same manner as wheel cases, pinch them close at one end;
then, with a rammer, drive the ends down flat, and, afterwards,
ram in about one-third of a diameter of dried clay.
The diameter of the former for these cases, must be the same
as for sky-rockets. Tourbillons are to be rammed in moulds,
without a nipple, or in a mould without its foot. (<cite>Ency. Brit.</cite>)</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. IX. Of Balloon Cases, or Paper Shells.</i></p>

<p>First, prepare an oval former, turned out of smooth wood;
then paste a quantity of brown, or cartridge paper, and let it
lie until the paste is quite soaked through. This being done,
rub the former with soap or grease, to prevent the paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
from sticking to it. Next, lay the paper on in small slips, until
you have made it one-third the thickness of the shell intended.
Having this done, set it to dry; and when dry, cut
it round the middle, and the two halves will easily come off:
but, observe, when you cut, to leave about one inch not cut,
which will make the halves join much better than if quite
separated. When you have some ready to join, place the
halves even together, and paste a slip of paper round the
opening, to hold them together, and let them dry. Then lay
on paper, all over as before, every where equally, excepting
that end which goes downward in the mortar, which may be
a little thicker than the rest; for that part, which receives
the blow from the pounder in the chamber of the mortar,
consequently requires the greatest strength.</p>

<p>When the shell is perfectly dry, burn a vent at the top,
with an iron, large enough for the fuse. This method will
answer for balloons from 4 inches <span class="xs"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>5</sub></span>ths, to 8 inches in diameter;
but, if they are larger, or required to be thrown to
a great height, let the first shell be turned of elm, instead
of being made of paper.</p>

<p>For balloons 4 inches <span class="xs"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>5</sub></span>ths, let the former be 3 inches <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>th,
in diameter, and 5<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches long. For a balloon of 5<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches,
the diameter of the former must be 4 inches, and 8 inches
long. For a balloon of 8 inches, let the diameter of the
form be 5 inches and <span class="xs"><sup>15</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span>ths, and 11 inches <span class="xs"><sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>ths long.
For a 10 inch balloon, let the form be 7 inches <span class="xs"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span>ths, in
diameter, and 14<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches long. The thickness of a shell for
a balloon of 4 inches <span class="xs"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>5</sub></span>ths, must be <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> an inch. For a balloon
of 5<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches, let the thickness of the paper be <span class="xs"><sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>ths, of
an inch; for an 8 inch balloon, <span class="xs"><sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>ths, of an inch; and for a
ten inch balloon, 1 inch and <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>th of an inch.</p>

<p>Shells, that are designed for stars only, may be made
quite round, and the thinner they are at the opening, the better;
for if they are too strong, the stars are apt to break at
the busting of the shell. When making the shell, employ a
pair of callipers, or a round gage; so that you may not lay
the paper thicker in one place than other, and also that you
may be able to know, when the shell is of a proper thickness.
Balloons must always be made to go easy into the mortars.

<p class="centerx"><i>Sect. X. Of Cases for Illumination Port-fires.</i></p>

<p>These must be made very thin, of paper, and rolled on
formers; from 2 to <span class="xs"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>ths of an inch in diameter, and from 2<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
to 6 inches long: they are pinched close at one end, and left
open at the other. When they are to be filled, put in but a little
composition at a time, and ram it lightly, so as not to break
the case. Three or four rounds of paper, with the last round
pasted, will be sufficiently strong for these cases. (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sect. XI. Of Cases and Moulds for Common Port-fires.</i></p>

<p>Common port-fires, are intended purposely to fire the
works, their fire being very slow, and the heat of the flame
so intense, that, if applied to rockets, leaders, &amp;c. it will fire
them immediately. When used, they are held in copper
sockets, fixed in the end of a long stick. These sockets are
made like port-crayons, only with a screw instead of a ring.</p>

<p>Port-fires, or <i>lances of service of the French</i>, may be made
of any length, but are seldom more than 21 inches long.</p>

<p>The interior diameter of port-fire moulds should be <span class="xs"><sup>10</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span>ths,
of an inch, and the diameter of the former half an inch.
The cases must be rolled wet with paste, and one end pinched
or folded down. The moulds should be made of brass,
and to take in 2 pieces lengthwise: when the case is in the
two sides, they are held together by brass rings or hoops,
which are made to fit over the outside. The bore of the
mould must not be quite through, so that there will be no
occasion for a foot. The French make the cases of five
thicknesses of paper, and form the moulds upon rollers of
<span class="xs"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>ths of an inch in diameter.</p>

<p>Port fire, according to the full acceptation of the term <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Porte-feu</i>
of the French, means a <i>porter</i>, or carrier of fire, and
implies all sorts of fusées or matches, by which fire is communicated.</p>

<p>In a treatise on <cite>Military Fire-works</cite>, as taught at Strasburg
in 1764, an extract of which was translated and published
by order of the War Department in 1800, there are
some observations on port-fires, which, as the mode of making
them according to these directions appears to have
been adopted, may be useful to notice in this place.</p>

<p>"<i>Port-fires</i> may be made in two ways. The first is made
and beaten in a mould; the other simply rolled on a ramrod,
and filled lying on the table.</p>

<p>"To make port-fires of the first kind, the mould must be
made of dry wood, such as pear-tree, nut or box wood. The
height of the mould is 13.85 inches; its diameter at the bottom,
3.2 inches; its diameter above, 2.13 inches; diameter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
of the hole or caliber, .62 inches; height of the base, 2.13 inches;
its diameter, 3.2 inches.</p>

<p>"The base of the mould has in the middle a nob, which
the turner leaves there, the diameter of which is equal to
the whole of the mould, and one inch high, including the
circle, which should be rounded like a hemisphere. There
must be three rods, one of which, of hard wood to roll the
cartridge upon; the two others of iron to ram down with.
The one to roll upon, or the form, is to be of the length of
the mould, exclusive of the handle, which is 3.2 inches
longer. The diameter of this rod is .45 parts of an inch.
The first, or greater one to charge with, is the same length
with that to roll upon; the second is but half the length, and
both are .44 parts of an inch in diameter.</p>

<p>"To make good cartridges, you must have good paper,
well sized, cut according to the length of the rolling rod or
form, which must be rolled very tightly round the form, so
that the vacancy left may be exactly equal to the size of the
mould, and that the paper should exactly fill the space between
the form and the mould. Then the form is drawn
out, after having tied it at the end with packthread. To
fill it, it must be replaced in the mould. A cupful of composition
is then put in, and five or six strokes given with the
large ramrod. The ramrod is then withdrawn, and a new
charge is put in, which is beaten like the first, until the
cartridge is filled to the height of the mould. It is then
drawn out, and primed with priming powder.</p>

<p>"The port-fire is filled with ease, in using a tunnel placed
at the end of the cartouch, through which you pass the rod.</p>

<p class="center">"<i>Composition of Port-fires of the first kind.</i></p>

<p class="p1">"After having mixed these materials well together with the
hand, and then with a rolling pin, you pass them through a
hair sieve, and fill your wooden bowls.</p>

<p>"<i>The second kind of Port-fires</i>, are made in rolling
strips of paper 3 inches wide, and 1.278 inches long, on a
form of hard wood, about 14 inches long, and .35 parts of an
inch in diameter. When about two-thirds of the paper is
rolled, the remainder of it is to be pasted over with paste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
made of flour and glue. You then finish it, by passing your
hand along the extremity of the pasted paper. Having finished
the number required, you place them in the sun, or near
a stove, and turn them from time to time, to prevent them
from sticking together, or bending.</p>

<p>"Cartridges being well dried, you must fill them with the
following composition. Fold the paper at one of the ends,
and at the other, pour in the composition, placing your cartridge
against the composition; and having placed it perpendicularly
on the table, you give it several strokes, to drive
down the composition. Then you take your iron rod, which
is .53 parts of an inch longer than the one which you use to
roll with, and a little less in thickness at the top. There
should be a ring, that it may hang to the finger, and move
the more easily. Having laid your cartridges on the table,
you introduce the rod, and with it compress the composition.
Having withdrawn it, more is put in, it is pressed
again, and so on until entirely full. You will take care to
press the last layer of the composition more than the other,
to prevent its falling out by moving.</p>

<p>"The port-fire cartridges being finished, they are laid by
for use, putting ten in a packet as before.</p>

<p>It may be sufficient to observe, that the present improved
process of making port-fires is preferable. (See <a href="#PORx"><i>Port-fires</i>.</a>)</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="PASx" id="PASx"></a><i>Sec. XII. Of Pasteboard, and its Uses.</i></p>

<p>The pasteboard, used in pyrotechny, is made of fine white
paper, by joining together five, and sometimes six, seven,
and eight sheets of paper. That which is generally employed,
is made of five sheets, and the other descriptions are employed
for large cases. Sized paper is preferable, having
more firmness than the other.</p>

<p>Pasteboard is made in the following way: A paste of flour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
is first prepared with hot water, and passed through a hair
sieve, to separate the lumps. A sheet of paper is stretched
upon a table, and covered, by means of a brush, with paste,
and a sheet is then laid over it. This is compressed, and another
coat of paste applied; then another sheet, then paste,
and the number is added according to the thickness required.
After five or more sheets are thus pasted together, a dry
sheet is laid over, and the operation is repeated, till five more
are joined.  Then a dry sheet is put on, and the pasting is
renewed. By this means, every five sheets are joined together,
and the sheet, thus formed, is kept apart from the
rest, by the dry sheet. A pile of pasteboard, consisting of
some hundred sheets, may be made in this manner at one
time. They are then put into a press for the space of five
or six hours, by which they become firmly united, and all the
extraneous paste is pressed out. When a press cannot be had,
they may be put between boards, and heavy weights laid on.
The pasteboard is then hung up in the air to dry, and again
submitted to the press, to remove any inequalities, and to
make it smooth.</p>

<p>When glazed paper is used for making pasteboard, we
may employ, alternately, a sheet of brown paper. It is better,
however, to use more of the glazed paper, than of the
brown paper. Pasteboard of three thicknesses will be sufficient
for most purposes. It is this kind, which is used for
the heads of rockets.</p>

<p>Several kinds of paper, however, are used in fire-works.
For small preparations, common white paper is sufficient.
For port-fire cases, the common brown paper; for the joints,
guarding places from fire, and covering tubes of communication,
any kind of gray paper; and for covering marrons,
the most indifferent kind may be used. Cartridge paper, as
known by that name, may be used for a variety of purposes.</p>

<p>Paper may be rendered incombustible, or nearly so, by
soaking it repeatedly in a strong solution of alum. In the
<cite>Literary Journal</cite> of 1785, of Petersburg, there is a discovery
mentioned of a kind of pasteboard, which neither fire can
consume, nor water soften. It appears that alumina, and its
salt (alum) were used in this preparation.</p>

<p>In the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal des Arts et Manufactures</cite>, tom. ii, p. 205, is an
account of the manufacture of pasteboard at Malmedy; and
in the Transactions of the Society of Stockholm for 1785, is
a description of the process for making the Swedish stone
paper, which resists equally fire and water. Stone paper is
manufactured in France, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire de l'Industrie</cite>, article<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
<i>Carton</i>), by taking two parts of martial earth, (ochre, for instance),
and mixing them with one part of animal oil, and
two parts of vegetable matter, previously made into a pulp.
The <cite>British Repository of Arts</cite> contains several specifications
of patents for the preparation of the same paper.</p>

<p>Although paper may be rendered very difficult of combustion
by the process already mentioned, that of soaking it
in a strong solution of alum, yet to make a paper completely
indestructible by fire, it must be made of amianthus. The
process for manufacturing paper with this mineral, was announced
in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gazette de France</cite> in 1778. Professor Carbury
received a medal for the invention.</p>

<p>Incombustible paper, for cartridges, ought to have the property,
not of inflaming, but of simply carbonizing, when exposed
to heat. M. Brugnatelli (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bulletin des Neustin</cite>) recommends
the paper to be prepared with silicated alkali, commonly
called the liquor of flints. Muriate of potassa, and
supersulphate of alumina-and-potassa are both used for a
similar purpose.</p>

<p>Paper made according to Brugnatelli's process, is merely
carbonized by fire, and reduced to powder.</p>

<p>M. Hermbstaedt (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bulletin des Découvertes</cite>,) observes, that
paper, made with silicated liquor, attracts humidity, and
proposes simply a solution of green vitriol, which has not
that property.</p>

<p>Paper may be stained, or coloured, in a variety of ways,
as is the case with the portable Chinese fire-works, that are
brought to this country. Thus, a red paper may be formed
by dipping it in a decoction of brazil wood and alum; yellow,
by using fustic; a green, by a mixed bath of blue and
yellow dye, or a solution of copper, &amp;c. Coloured paper
may be glazed with weak size, rubbing it afterwards with a
polished stone.</p>

<p>The Chinese are in possession of several processes, as well
for making, as for ornamenting paper. Their silver paper,
which is sometimes put on their fire-works, is variously figured.
The art is very simple. Two scruples of glue, and one scruple
of alum, are dissolved in a pint of water. This is evaporated,
and put on the paper, where they want it, and finally
pulverized <i>silvery talc</i> (a magnesian stone) is sifted over it.
It is then exposed to the sun, and the extraneous talc is
brushed off. The glue, it is obvious, causes the talc to adhere.</p>

<p>The <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'abbe Raynal'">Abbé Raynal</ins> (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire Philosophique des deux Indes</cite>
t. iii, p. 225) has some interesting facts respecting Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
paper. Some useful remarks on paper hangings, paper for
decorations, tapestry paper, &amp;c. may be found in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal
de Paris</cite>, 1785, the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lycée des Arts</cite> 1795, and the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Encyclopedie
Method. Arts et Metiers</cite>, t. iv, p. 393. On the formation
of paper vases, in imitation of Japan vases, consult the
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire de l'Industrie</cite>, article <i>vases</i>. The different patents,
respecting paper, may be seen in the British <cite>Repertory
of Arts</cite>, and the manufacture of paper generally, in Rees's
<cite>Cyclopedia</cite>, and the <cite>Artist's Manual</cite>. The American improvements
are noticed in the latter. Beckman (<cite>History of
Inventions</cite>) has a variety of remarks on the same subject;
and, in his article on paper hangings, &amp;c. vol. ii, p. 161, says,
that artists employed the silver-coloured glimmer (isinglass)
for the covering of paper, and that the nuns of Reichtinstein
ornamented with it, the images, which they made; as the nuns
in France, and other catholic countries, ornamented their
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">agni Dei</i>, by strewing over them a shining kind of talc.</p>

<p>The quality of the paste, which is employed in making
pasteboard, ought to be attended to. The flour should be of
rye, and well boiled, after mixing it uniformly with cold water.
Strong bookbinder's paste has the addition of a fourth,
fifth, or sixth of the weight of the flour, of powdered alum.
The <i>patent paste</i> is prepared by extracting starch from potatoes,
in the usual manner, by means of cold water, and
mixing it with mashed potatoes, after they have been boiled,
and boiling the whole in water.</p>

<p>The Japanese cement, or rice-glue, may be advantageously
used in many cases. It is formed by mixing rice flour intimately
with cold water, and then boiling it very gently. It
is beautifully white, and dries almost transparent. We are
told, that it is preferable, in every respect, to the paste made
with flour; and its strength is such, that paper, pasted together
with it, will sooner separate in their own substance than
at the joining.</p>

<p>The Chinese, to prevent accidents, and in order that they
may fire their works without injury, and particularly their
cases which are charged with brilliant fire, have a process,
for preparing a paste of a different kind. With the exception
of the clay, the same substances have been employed
elsewhere for the like purpose. It consists of one pound of
rye flour, boiled in water; to which is added, a small handful
of common salt, the whole being <i>thickened</i> with finely
pulverized white clay. The pasteboard, we are informed,
which is made with this paste, is not only very solid, but not
so susceptible of inflammation, as that prepared in the usual
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>A Chinese paste is announced in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bulletin de la Société
d'Encouragement</cite>, 1815, which is very economical, and used
with success. It is made by mixing ten pounds of bullock's
blood, with one pound of quicklime, and occasionally flour.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XIII. Of the Pulverization of Substances.</i></p>

<p>Various substances are employed either in grain, laminæ,
filings, or impalpable powder. When treating of nitre, sulphur,
and charcoal, and other bodies, we mentioned the processes
for reducing them to powder. It will be sufficient here
to remark, that cannon powder, when it is converted into
fine powder, takes the name of meal-powder; the conversion
being effected, by beating it in a leather sack, already described,
by rolling it upon the mealing-table, or by the action
of a wooden pestle in a mortar. It is then passed through a
fine sieve. The sack is said to be a preferable mode, as nearly
the whole of it becomes pulverized. Saltpetre, sulphur, charcoal,
antimony, &amp;c. may be reduced to powder in a mortar
of cast-iron, marble, or wood. The best method of pulverizing
saltpetre is given under that article, which consists in
boiling it in a copper, and stirring it continually at the end
of the process. The best mode of pulverizing, or bringing
cast-iron to a state of fineness, is mentioned in the article on
<i>Iron</i>. Some of the metals, as iron, zinc, the alloy of copper
and zinc, (brass,) &amp;c. are brought to a sufficient fineness by
the file. The filings, if so required, may be afterwards sifted.
Zinc, when in small pieces, may be pulverized, by means of
a steel mortar and pestle. It may be granulated, by suffering
it to run, when melted, through an iron cullender into water.
For the pulverization of camphor, see <a href="#CAMx">that article.</a></p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="MIXx" id="MIXx"></a><i>Sec. XIV. Of Mixtures.</i></p>

<p>All compositions for fire-works, are generally made at first
in mortars, and the mixture is then finished by passing it
through a sieve; it being returned to the sieve, and again
sifted. This operation is sometimes repeated several times.
Of all compositions, that for sky-rockets requires to be most
intimately blended.</p>

<p>To receive the sifted matter, leather or parchment is used;
but, in lieu of either, pasteboard, or several sheets of paper,
cemented or glued together will answer. It is obvious, that,
in preparing mixtures, of two, three, or four articles, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
should not only be very fine, but uniformly and intimately
mixed.</p>

<p>Several receivers, made by stitching leather over a rim, in
the manner of a sieve, would be found very convenient; but
wooden bowls, and copper basins, are generally used.</p>

<p>Some ingredients must be passed through a lawn sieve,
after having been previously incorporated. A receiver, with
a top, is the kind of sieve to be preferred. The composition
for wheels, and common works, need not be so fine as for
rockets. But in all fixed works, from which the fire is to play
regularly, the ingredients must be very fine, and great care
taken in mixing them together; and in those works, into the
composition of which, iron and steel enter, the hands must
neither touch them, nor moisture be suffered to come in contact.
In either case, they would be apt to rust.</p>

<p class="center">OBSERVATIONS ON FIRE-WORKS.</p>


<p>In Europe, the invention of fire-works is of a recent date,
and ascribed to the Italians. In China, however, fire-works
have been known for centuries. Some recent exhibitions at Pekin
prove, that the Chinese have attained to a degree of perfection,
not surpassed by the artists of France, Italy, or England.
The observations of Mr. Barrow, (<cite>Travels in China</cite>),
on this subject are worthy of notice. "The fire-works, in
some particulars," says he, "exceeded any thing of the kind
I had ever seen. In grandeur, magnificence, and variety, they
were, I own, inferior to the Chinese fire-works, we had seen
at Batavia, but infinitely superior in point of novelty, neatness,
and ingenuity of contrivance. One piece of machinery I
greatly admired; a chest five feet square, was hoisted up by
a pulley, to the height of fifty or sixty feet from the ground:
the bottom was so constructed as then, suddenly, to fall out,
and make way for twenty or thirty strings of lanterns, enclosed
in a box, to descend from it, unfolding themselves from
one another by degrees, so as, at last, to form a collection of
full 500, each having a light of a beautifully coloured flame,
burning brightly within it. This devolution and development
of lanterns was several times repeated, and, at every time,
exhibited a difference of colour and figure. On each side,
was a correspondence of smaller boxes, which opened in like
manner as the others, and let down an immense net-work of
fire, with divisions and compartments of various forms and
dimensions, round and square, hexagons, octagons, &amp;c. which
shone like the brightest burnished copper, and flashed like
prismatic colours, with every impulse of the wind. The di<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>versity
of colours, with which the Chinese have the secret of
clothing fire, seems one of the chief merits of their pyrotechny.
The whole concluded with a volcano, or general explosion
and discharge of suns, stars, squibs, crackers, rockets,
and granadoes, which involved the gardens for above an
hour in a cloud of intolerable smoke."</p>

<p>Thevenot (<cite>Travels in the Levant</cite>) says, that during the
bairam, or carnival, which takes place with a great deal of
ceremony, the sultan causes fire-works to be played off all
night; the sultan and sultanas diverting themselves with these
and other amusements. Dr. Pococke (<cite>Travels through <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Eygpt'">Egypt</ins></cite>),
says, that at Cairo, when the Nile is high, besides aquatic
excursions, concerts of music, and other diversions, fire-works
form a part of those pleasures and recreations. In a <cite>Description
of the East Indies</cite>, fire-works are stated to be often exhibited
at the marriage of the Banians or Gentoos.</p>

<p>With respect to the arrangement and display of sundry
pieces of fire-works, either alone or combined, the effect depends,
as well upon the ingredients, which compose the several
sorts of fire, as on the taste displayed in their exhibition.
It would be altogether unnecessary to notice, at this
time, the order of exhibition usually adopted, reserving this
subject until we have gone into the various preparations,
which constitute, as it is called, a <i>system of fire-works</i>. In
order, however, to become familiar with the manner of arranging
them, as well as with their composition and preparation,
whether designed for a general or a partial display, for
the open air or for rooms, we purpose to appropriate distinct
chapters for their consideration.</p>

<p>The variety of preparations, which become necessary where
a full exhibition is intended, the accuracy of the different
mixtures, and the adjustment of cases to wheels, whether
vertical or horizontal, and the arrangement of the leaders, or
communicators of fire, from one part to another of the work,
with many other circumstances, in relation to stars, rain, &amp;c.
all require, from the artist, particular care and attention.</p>

<p>For the mere exhibition of one or two pieces, as a plain
rocket, rocket with serpents, or the like, and likewise for
some exhibitions, on water, called aquatic fire-works, in rooms
or apartments, with scented fire, or on the stage; the preparations
are by no means extensive.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, our design to present a view of the whole
subject in detail, and to speak of the different combinations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
of arrangement, which are made according to fancy and taste,
and calculated, as we have remarked, either for small or extensive
exhibitions.</p>

<p>We have, in a preceding part of this work, made some observations
on certain preliminary operations; on the various
sizes and charges for cases; on the paper, necessary to be
used, for different kinds of cases; and, generally, on sundry
manipulations, connected with the making, filling, and preparation
of sundry descriptions of fire-works. It remains,
therefore, in the course of this subject, to give the several
formulæ, with such observations as immediately concern the
subject; and for this purpose we will pursue the following
order:</p>

<p>Frazier is of opinion, that the arrangement of fire-works,
which have been exhibited with effect, may, on particular occasions,
be established as a guide. For this reason, Morel
introduces an account of the celebrated fire-works at Versailles
and Paris, in 1739, which we shall here notice.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Exhibition of fire-works at the city house of Paris, on occasion
of the peace in 1739.</i></p>

<p>The theatre was a building, forty feet square, with a pyramid
of eighty feet in height, on which was placed a globe,
containing artificial fire, and accompanied with sixteen large
vases of different forms.</p>

<p>All the edifice was ornamented with a variety of decorations,
combined with figures and emblems of peace, and
painted on marble.</p>

<p>After several guns were fired, as a signal, the exhibition
commenced, with the discharge of a large number of <i>honorary
rockets</i>, fired three and three at a time. Nearly five hundred
<i>lances</i>, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">saucissons</i> garnished, lighted the four sides
of the body of the works. Thirty cases of artificial fire,
furnished with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fusées</i>, and double <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marquises</i>, were placed
upon the large terrace, with 1200 <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pots à feu</i> (fire-pots); and
upon the ballustrade of the same terrace, forty <i>jets</i>, twenty of
which were <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aigrettes</i>, and eight, revolving suns, four in the
middle, and four on the angles. Four large fixed suns were
placed above the four which revolved, and four <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pattes d'oies</i>,
(<i>geese feet</i>,) were situated before the grand pedestal of the
pyramid, with <i>jets</i>, and <i>pots</i> with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aigrette</i>.</p>

<p>At the foot of the pyramid, on the steps, were placed 1200
<i>fire-pots</i>, and upon the pedestal of the pyramid, twelve large
pots of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aigrette</i>, on the extremity of which, were arranged
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aigrettes</i> in <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'groupes'">groups</ins>, and three large luminous stars, formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
of two hundred fire lances. The four faces of the pyramid
were lined with about fifty other <i>jets</i>; after which there were
cascades, or fountains of fire. The first horizontal wheel
was composed of, or furnished with, six cases, and contained
also two hundred and forty double <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marquises</i>. The second
wheel contained two hundred and forty <i>fire-pots</i>, and six
cases, with upwards of three hundred <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fusées</i>, all in stars,
twelve air balloons in the middle, but placed at the bottom
of the fire-work. To this was added, twelve artificial bombs,
fixed in mortars, and placed near the cannon, which pointed
to the works.</p>

<p>This outline of the brilliant exhibition of fire-works in
1739, will give the reader some idea of the taste and magnificence
of the work at that period. We may here add, however,
that the improvements, which have since taken place,
both in the composition of artificial fire, and its arrangement,
are such as to place the modern exhibitions of this kind far
above that we have just spoken of. But the following account
of the execution of fire-works, performed on the <i>Pont
Neuf</i>, in August of the same year, is more extensive, as the
exhibition appears to have been more grand.</p>

<p>The theatre, which represented the temple of Hymen, was
an edifice of the doric order. It was square. A gallery of
five hundred feet in length was supported by thirty-two columns,
four feet in diameter, and thirty-three feet in height.
In the interior, were two solid bodies, and also one or more
stair cases. At the two sides of this temple, along the parapets
of the <i>Pont Neuf</i>, were thirty-six pyramids, eighteen of
which were forty feet high, and the others, twenty-six feet.
They were joined by what is called, in architecture, a <i>corbil</i>,
and carried vases on their summits.</p>

<p>The signal for the exhibition was given by the firing of
cannon. Immediately, were seen, rising into the air from
each side of the temple, three hundred rockets, fired twelve at
a time. They were discharged from the eight towers of the <i>Pont
Neuf</i>, which face the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Tuilleries'">Tuileries</ins>, and were succeeded (upon
the same towers,) by one hundred and eighty <i>pots of aigrette</i>.
The <i>Chinese trees</i> were disposed in such a manner, as to
form a pyramid. A succession of <i>Chinese trees</i> now appeared,
immediately on the tablet of the cornice of the
bridge; then followed a great <i>fixed sun</i>, sixty feet in diameter,
which appeared in all its splendour, in the midst of surrounding
objects. Under this, was placed a large <i>illuminated
cypher</i>, thirty feet in height, which consisted of different
colours, in imitation of jewels. At the sides, between
the pillars of the temple, were also two other artificial <i>cyphers</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
six feet high, and composed of <i>blue fire</i>, which had a
surprising effect. There were placed upon the two walks of
the bridge, on the right and left of the temple, beyond the
illuminated pyramids, two hundred cases of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fusées de partement</i>,
of five or six dozen each. These cases were fired,
five at a time, and succeeded the rockets. They began, on
each side, from the first near the temple, and in succession,
as far as the extremities to the right and left. There appeared
then cascades of <i>red fire</i>, issuing from the five arches
of the bridge, which seemed to pierce the illumination, and
so vivid was the light, that the eye could scarcely sustain it.
The combat of the <i>dragons</i> next ensued; and the <i>water-fire</i>,
or aquatic fire-works, covered almost the whole surface of
the river. Eight <i>boats</i>, containing works for the display on
water, were arranged in symmetrical order, with the <i>boats of
illumination</i>. There were also thirty-six <i>cascades</i> or fountains
of fire, about thirty feet high, which appeared to rise
out of the water. This exhibition of the cascades, was preceded
by a revolving <i>water-sun</i>, and a discharge of <i>stars</i>
from one hundred and sixty pots of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aigrettes</i>, which were
placed at the lower part of the terrace.</p>

<p>Four large boats, containing aquatic fire-works, were moored
near the arches of the bridge, and four others were disposed
on the side next to the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Tuilleries'">Tuileries</ins>. The fire-works,
which they contained, consisted of a great number of large
and small casks, charged with <i>gerbes</i> and <i>pots</i>, which, when
discharged, filled the air with <i>serpents</i>, <i>stars</i>, &amp;c. There was,
also, a large number of <i>hand gerbes</i>, and revolving <i>water-suns</i>.</p>

<p>When the exhibition of the cascades was finished, the
grand chandelier, composed of six thousand <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fusées</i>, and resting
on the top of the temple, was lighted. Both extremities
were set on fire at the same time. This was followed by two
smaller chandeliers, previously placed on each side of the
foot-way of the bridge, and containing five hundred <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fusées</i>
each.</p>

<p>The fire-works, exhibited at Versailles, in the same year,
and on the same occasion, were also magnificent. The account
we have of them is the following: There was a large building
erected, representing the temple of Hymen, nine hundred
feet in length, and one hundred and twenty in height, in the
gardens of Versailles, in front of the grand gallery. It was
in the form of a portico, with re-enterings and salients at the
two extremities, which faced the two great basins; and, in
the centre, were illuminated works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>The forges of Vulcan, in the grottos, commenced with the
sound of the hammers of the Cyclops. The sparks, then
produced, covered, in a few instants, the two basins, provided
for the purpose, with an apparent sheet or volume of fire.</p>

<p>From the summit of a rock, came out a <i>jet</i> of brilliant
fire, more than thirty feet in height, accompanied with four
others of less elevation, representing torrents of fire as from
volcanoes. To this succeeded a great <i>jet</i> of water, forty-five
feet in height, leading with it, as it were, seventeen other <i>jets</i>,
which surrounded the rocks, and rushing forth with avidity,
produced, in appearance, a mixture of flame and water,
which, in the end, consumed entirely the two grottos.</p>

<p>After this, the fire-works, behind the decoration, were exhibited.
Two hundred and fifty <i>boxes</i>, and as many caissons,
arranged on both sides of the turf, which descended to the
grass, were first exhibited. This, however, was less brilliant
than the fire from the Cyclops. To this succeeded a brilliant
fire, placed before the illumination. This composition, elevating
itself to a mean height, pleased equally by its form,
as by its brilliant whiteness. This fire composed three distinct
decorations, which succeeded as the one replaced the
other, following the same order. The spouting waters,
which decorated the gardens, together with the artificial fire,
appeared in the form of cascades and fountains. The first
decoration, at the head of the two great basins, exhibited
two handsome cascades, in the form of a white sheet, and
surmounted with an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aigrette</i> twenty-five feet in height. This
was accompanied with two <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pattes d'oies</i> (<i>geese feet</i>) of seven
<i>jets</i> each, and accompanied also with fifty <i>jets</i> playing from
each of the sides, twenty feet in height, and occupying the
fore ground.</p>

<p>The second appeared under the form of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pattes d'oies</i>,
of eleven jets each, of which four, at the head of the basins,
were large, and all projected a body of fire, fifty feet in
height. They were intermixed, however, with the pots of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aigrettes</i>, twenty feet in height, which threw a crown, composed
of stars, &amp;c. to the height of fifty feet, which produced
in the atmosphere a lively and brilliant light.</p>

<p>The third represented thirteen fountains of fire, twenty-five
feet in height, and thirty feet in diameter, with an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aigrette</i>
in each. In these, there were six circular, and six
spiral fountains. The largest was placed between the two
basins, with four others on the right and left.</p>

<p>The fountains, which represented the combat of animals,
had in each of them two. The animals threw, at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
time, jets of water and fire, and, between each of the fountains,
large brilliant jets or spouts. This part of the exhibition
was finished, by throwing into the air the <i>garnishing</i>
or furniture of the pots, which produced crowns, &amp;c. of
great splendour.</p>

<p>To these three decorations, succeeded the exhibition of
twelve <i>Italian pots</i>, placed six in a row, and in the middle
of two great basins, which produced repeated discharges.</p>

<p>The whole was then closed by setting fire to two great
chandeliers, which were placed behind the grand decoration,
and contained more than three thousand <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fusées</i>.</p>

<p>It appears from history, that when Henry II, entered
Rheims, there was a representation of several figures in fire;
and in 1606, the duke of Sully made an exhibition of fire-works
at Fontainbleau; and in 1612, Morel, commissary of
artillery, prepared a splendid exhibition of the same kind.
It appears, also, that the art of communicating fire from one
piece of fire-work to another, as in the combined piece of
nine mutations, and the pyric-piece (which will be noticed
hereafter) was discovered by Ruggeri, artificer to the king, at
Boulogne, in France, in 1743.</p>

<p>It may not be improper, in concluding this article, to notice,
in a general manner, the exhibition of the works of fire by
the ancients.</p>

<p>The fire-works of the ancients consisted, for the principal
part, of illuminations, and the use of some particular descriptions
of fire. They were, however, very imperfect.
Since the invention of gunpowder, its effects as well as its
modifications, in this particular, became known; and, so far
as respects the various preparations of artificial fire, gunpowder
itself has produced a new era in pyrotechny, and
the various modifications, to which it is subject, have occasioned
a great variety of fire-works.</p>

<p>According to the authority we have on the subject, it appears,
that the ancients, in exhibiting their preparations of
fire, set them off by the hand, and directed them among the
people, which produced great eclat.</p>

<p>Another description of fire-work was designed expressly
for the theatre, part of which was exhibited in the form of
man or beast. Of their theatrical works, our accounts are imperfect.
Their works, generally, were formed of <i>lardons</i>,
<i>stars</i>, and <i>fire-balls</i>, in imitation of <i>grenades</i>, and <i>flying fusées</i>
or <i>rockets</i>. That they neither had a system in arranging,
nor regularity in exhibiting their works, is evident from a variety
of circumstances; for, although the number of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
pieces, such as they were, was great; yet, they so crowded
them upon each other, as that, when they were fired, they frequently
destroyed the persons in their vicinity. An author of
antiquity observes, that "he has seen a great many artificial
machines, but, to speak the truth, few which have succeeded;
and it is commonly after acclamations of joy, that the spectacle
is finished by the destruction of some, and the wounding
of a great number."</p>

<p>This fact is not at all surprising; because their works were
prepared in wooden tubes, at least among the more modern,
as paper cases were not then known. These tubes, moreover,
were not secured by any covering, and were the more likely
to burst, and hence accidents were common. The moderns,
however, have rejected altogether the use of wood, in the
formation of cases, and have availed themselves of the use
of paper, which can be made of any size or thickness. (See
<a href="#PASx"><i>Pasteboard</i>.</a>)</p>

<p>Notwithstanding wood is not employed by experienced
fire-workers, partly in consequence of the reasons just given,
and partly because paper furnishes a material in every way
adapted to the purpose; yet, within a few years past, reed
has been used in Spain, which, however, is secured by cloth
and pack thread. Such substitutes, nevertheless, besides being
more or less dangerous, have nothing to recommend
them. It is a fact, that the Chinese, who undoubtedly excel
in the manufacture of fire-works, if we believe the authority
of the English embassy, use altogether paper cases; but
in the <i>war-rocket</i>, employed by the natives against the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Brit-tish'">British</ins>
at <i>Seringapatam</i>, which did, according to the English
account, great execution, their cases were formed entirely of
sheet-iron. In their smaller works, which are prepared expressly
for sale, paper cases are altogether made use of.</p>

<p class="center"><a name="THFx" id="THFx"></a>FIRE-WORKS FOR THEATRICAL PURPOSES.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. I. Of Puffs, or Bouffées.</i></p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouffée</i>, according to the term used in French, signifies
a species of fire, which exhibits itself in <i>puffs</i>, or in alternate
appearances, more or less brilliant. It is also called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the flambeaux of the furies. This description of artificial fire
is used in <i>theatres</i>, and frequently in ordinary fire-works. It
is fired from, and exhibited with, a funnel of tin, or sheet
iron, having a hole at the apex of the cone. The hole is to be
sufficiently large to admit the fire from a quick match. It is
particularly calculated, when a gulf, crater, or the caves of
the Cyclops, intended to eject flame, are to be exhibited.</p>

<p>Although many compositions may be used for this purpose,
yet the following, which is employed in France, is considered
preferable:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Composition for Bouffées.</i></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="70%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl wd60">Saltpetre</td><td class="tdr wd5">16</td><td class="tdr wd5">oz.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Meal-powder</td><td class="tdr">4</td><td class="tdr">oz.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Charcoal</td><td class="tdr">8</td><td class="tdr">oz.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="p1">When the materials are well mixed, a piece of silk paper
is prepared in a round shape, by pressing it on the end of a
roller, in the same manner as the ordinary cases. About one
ounce of the composition is put into it, on which is placed
very lightly two drachms of meal-powder. A double quick-match
is now put on the meal-powder, and the paper is closed
by pressing it between the fingers. It is then tied with
twine. The quick-match is left sufficiently long to pass
through the hole at the apex of the cone, in which is introduced
the <i>puff</i>, being pressed a little at the bottom. The excess
of the quick-match, should there be any, is cut off within
an inch of the extremity of the funnel. When used, it is
inflamed by a lance or port fire. The effect of the puff, in the
first place, is to throw out of the funnel, by the meal-powder,
a volume of fire, which will cause the appearances before
mentioned.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. II. Of Eruptions.</i></p>

<p>If the appearance of a volcano, or the effect of a mine is
required in a piece, the following method is commonly followed:
a tin, sheet-iron, or brass box is provided, either round
or square, of nine inches in height, and three inches and a
half in diameter, and placed on a wooden stand, sufficiently
large to prevent it from overturning.</p>

<p>Three, four, or five ounces of the composition, mentioned
in <i>Sec. i.</i> of this chapter, is put into it, according to the effect
intended to be produced. The composition is pressed a
little with the hand, and a piece of quick-match is used. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
match projects out of the case, and is secured with a piece
of paper, pasted over its circumference.</p>

<p>When the fire is presented to the quick-match, it communicates
with rapidity to the inside of the box, or case, which
produces an eruption, from twelve to fifteen feet in height.
The effect may be made more or less great, by making the
boxes of a proportional size, or by using several of them at
the same time.</p>

<p>If a mine is the subject of representation, it is necessary
to employ some large <i>marrons</i>, which should communicate
with the boxes, and in such a manner, as that they may operate
at the same time.</p>

<p>This exhibition, it is obvious, may be varied according to
circumstances, either by employing a larger quantity of the
composition in several cases, or by using one or more marrons,
or some other descriptions of fire-works, the effect of
which is calculated to increase the flame, and to produce the
necessary variations.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. III. Of the Flames.</i></p>

<p>If a flame is to be represented, as for example, the effect
of an incendiary, and its appearance is to be prolonged, the
fire from tow being too transient, small iron kettles, of four
inches in diameter, and depth, may be used. In these are
put three or four ounces of the composition of the <i>lances of
service</i>, which is moistened with the oil or spirit of turpentine.
When set on fire, they will produce a blaze three or
four feet in height, and one and a half in diameter. Several
may be used, according to the effect required. See the composition
for the <a href="#LANx"><i>lances of service</i>.</a></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. IV. Of the Fire-rain.</i></p>

<p>A variety of compositions for fire-rain are used, which
will be noticed, when we speak of the <i>garnishing</i> of rockets,
and other fire-works.</p>

<p>Cases are prepared of seven-twelfths of an inch in diameter,
and ten inches long, which are choaked in such a manner,
as that the hole of communication should be one-third
of the diameter of the interior case. They are then charged
with the following composition:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Composition of the fire-rain.</i></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl wd60">Saltpetre</td><td class="tdr wd5">8</td><td class="tdl wd10">&nbsp;&nbsp;ounces.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Sulphur</td><td class="tdr">4</td><td class="tdc">do.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Meal powder</td><td class="tdr">16</td><td class="tdl">&nbsp;&nbsp;ounces.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Charcoal of oak</td><td class="tdr">2½</td><td class="tdc">do.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Pitcoal</td><td class="tdr">2½</td><td class="tdc">do.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="p1">When the cases are charged and primed, they are tied
upon a rod, having a groove cut in its length. In the inside
of the groove, is a port-fire, or leader, which is tied to the
cases with twine, and the groove is then covered with several
pieces of paper, in the shape of a band.</p>

<p>This precaution is thus taken for the theatre, in order to
prevent the inflamed port-fire from falling on the stage.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. V. Of other Compositions for Fire-rain, in Chinese fire.</i></p>

<p>The composition of Chinese fire, which we will have occasion
to mention more fully hereafter, is calculated to exhibit
a more brilliant fire, with a steady and uniform effect.
It is used principally on the French stage, in large operas.
It is charged and used, in all respects, like the preceding.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Composition of Chinese Fire.</i></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl wd60">Saltpetre,</td><td class="tdr wd5">8</td><td class="tdl wd10">&nbsp;&nbsp;ounces</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Meal powder,</td><td class="tdr">16</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Sulphur,</td><td class="tdr">4</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Charcoal,</td><td class="tdr">2</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Powdered cast iron,</td><td class="tdr">10</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="p1">The elegance of the flame, produced by this mixture, depends
entirely upon the effect, which cast iron possesses; and,
by its combination with charcoal, sulphur, meal powder, and
nitre, while an oxide of iron results from the combustion,
we have, likewise, other products, arising from the decomposition
of the nitre, and the union of carbon and sulphur
respectively with a part of the oxygen of the nitric acid of
the nitre. The gunpowder decomposes itself by reason of
the nature of its own composition; but the sulphur, charcoal,
and iron, decompose the nitric acid of the nitre, in the act
of combustion. So that, to produce the effect, an additional
quantity of nitre to that which is in the gunpowder, is required
in this preparation.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VI. Of Thunderbolts. (Foudres F.)</i></p>

<p>The thunderbolts are charged in cases of two-thirds of an
inch in diameter, in the same manner as cases for wheels and
rockets. They are primed, whitened, well pasted, and left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
to dry. Some preliminary operations are required in their
exhibition, as the use of the piercer, the tying of one end of
the case, which is to descend first from the top of the theatre,
&amp;c. A port-fire is used for setting them off.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Composition of Thunderbolts.</i></p>

</table>

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VII. Of Dragons and other Monsters.</i></p>

<p>In certain pieces, exhibitions of this kind are made. They
are formed in such a way, as to make them throw fire from
the mouth, nose, and ears, which is blown out into the air.
Cases, charged with brilliant fire, are so arranged that their
fire may act all at the same time. Puffs may also be produced
to go out at the mouth, by means of a tube or funnel,
placed behind the monster. These preparations and exhibitions
are so susceptible of variations, that, having a previous
knowledge of the composition and effect of the fire-work,
it may be so arranged as to produce a variety of appearances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VIII. Of Lightning.</i></p>

<p>The effect of lightning may be shown by several preparations.
Lycopodium, or puff-ball, is the substance most commonly
employed. When it cannot be procured, rosin may
be substituted; and, generally, as the latter is cheaper, it is
used. Rosin, reduced to an impalpable powder, and thrown
upon a flame, will produce the effect in a remarkable degree,
and when blown through a tube, the effect is more striking.</p>

<p>Several fluid substances, when ejected from a syringe on
a lighted candle, have the same appearance. Alcohol has
this effect. The difficulty of preparing and employing them,
has given the lycopodium a preference.</p>

<p>A tin or brass tube, larger at one end than the other, and
covered at the former end, with a cover, perforated with
holes, similar to the branch of a watering pot, is used for
holding the composition, or substance made use of. Through
this cover, or lid, a cotton wick is put, which, before lighting,
is well soaked in alcohol or spirits of wine. When
lighted, the torch or tube, containing the lycopodium, or rosin,
is shaken at the smaller extremity; when these substances
will pass through the holes in small quantities, and be successively
inflamed.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. IX. Of the Artifice of Destruction.</i></p>

<p>When, in any exhibition, palaces, castles, or forts are to
be demolished, or thrown down, there are about twenty
petards fixed on rods. Petards, for this use, are made with
cases, and sometimes with wheels. The cases are generally
three-quarters of an inch in diameter, charged with grain
powder, and choaked at both ends. They are arranged in a
zigzag direction.</p>

<p>This series of <i>crackers</i> has a fine effect. It is obvious,
that, in all these exhibitions, intelligent artizans may employ
various descriptions of artificial fire, where, in particular, it
often seems, that there is something yet to be wished for.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. X. Of the Spur-fire.</i></p>

<p>The spur-fire is so called, because its fire or sparks resemble
the rowel of a spur. It is used in theatres and in rooms.
It is the most beautiful of any yet known, and was invented
by the Chinese, but greatly improved in Europe.</p>

<p>It requires great care to make it properly. Care ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
be taken that all the ingredients are of the best quality, that
the lampblack is neither damp nor clodded, that the saltpetre
is the best refined, and the sulphur perfectly pure.
This composition is generally rammed into one or two ounce
cases, about five or six inches long, but not driven very hard;
and the cases must have their concave stroke struck very
smooth, and the choak or vent not quite so large as the
usual proportion: this charge, when driven, and kept a few
months, will be much better than when rammed. If kept
dry, it will last many years.</p>

<p>As the beauty of this composition cannot be seen at so
great a distance as brilliant fire, it has a better effect in a
theatre or room, than in the open air; and may be fired in a
chamber, without danger. Its effect is of so innocent a nature,
that it has been called <i>cold fire</i>; and so extraordinary is the
fire produced from this composition, that if well made, the
sparks will not burn a handkerchief when held in the midst
of them. The hand, brought in contact with the spark, will
feel only a sensation similar to that occasioned by the falling
of rain. When any of these spurs are fired singly, they are
called <i>artificial fire-pots</i>; but some of them, placed round a
transparent pyramid of paper, and fired in a large room,
make a very elegant appearance.</p>

<p class="p1">The saltpetre and sulphur must be first mixed together,
and sifted, and then put into a marble mortar, and the lampblack
with them, which are to be worked by degrees, with
a wooden pestle, till all the ingredients appear of one colour,
which will be a gray, approaching to black. It is then to be
tried by driving a little of it into a case, and fired in a dark
place; and if the sparks, which are called <i>stars</i>, or <i>pinks</i>,
come out in clusters, and afterwards spread well, without
any other sparks, it is a criterion of its goodness. If
any drossy sparks appear, and the stars are not full, it is
then not mixed sufficiently: but, if the pinks are very small,
and soon break, it is a proof that it has been rubbed too much;
for, in this case, few stars will appear. When, on the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>trary,
the mixture is not rubbed sufficiently, the combustion
will be too weak, and lumps, resembling dross, with an obscure
smoke, but without stars, will be emitted.</p>

<p>The peculiar effect of this composition is owing to the
carbon of the lampblack, one part of which is inflamed, its
combustion being supported by the oxygen gas of the atmosphere.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="COLx" id="COLx"></a><i>Sec. XI. Of the coloured Flame of Alcohol.</i></p>

<p>We have already remarked, in treating of alcohol, that
its flame may be changed of various colours, by using certain
native substances. See <a href="#ALCx"><i>Alcohol</i>.</a></p>

<p>Alcohol, thus mixed, or combined with substances, may
be exhibited on certain occasions; for even cotton, when immersed
in it, and set on fire, will show the same appearances.
Morel remarks, that, if vinegar, a small portion of crude tartar,
and common salt, and a still smaller quantity of saltpetre,
be mixed together, and distilled, a liquid will be obtained,
which burns with great brilliancy. It is doubtful, however,
if we judge from analogy, whether either tartar, the
salt, or saltpetre, will communicate any peculiar property to
the distilled vinegar; for these saline substances will remain
unaltered in the distilling vessel. The vinegar, nevertheless,
may be obtained in a more concentrated state, being deprived
of its colouring and other matter, and the greater part of its
water, and, therefore, approach to the state of acetic acid.</p>

<p>With respect to alcohol, it is known to dissolve a variety
of saline substances, most of which have the property of
changing the colour of its flame. Although we have not
made any experiments with the spirits of turpentine, yet we
are of opinion, that it may be used with resins, &amp;c. in the
same manner. In all cases, it is evident, that the fluid made
use of must be inflammable.</p>

<p><i>Macquer</i> (<cite>Memoirs of the Turin Academy</cite>) made a number
of experiments on the solubility of salts in alcohol, and
on the different coloured flames, which they produced. The
principal results of his experiments, are the following:</p>

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XII. Of Red fire.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Ure (<cite>Chemical Dictionary</cite>) informs us, that the beautiful
red, which is now frequently used at the theatres, is
composed of the following ingredients: 40 parts of dry nitrate
of strontia; 13 parts of finely powdered sulphur; 5 parts
of chlorate (hyperoxymuriate) of potassa, and 4 parts of
sulphuret of antimony. The chlorate of potassa and sulphuret
of antimony, should be powdered, separately, in a mortar,
and then mixed together on paper; after which they may
be added to the other ingredients, previously powdered and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
mixed. No other kind of mixture than rubbing together on
paper is required. Sometimes a little realgar is added to the
sulphuret of antimony, and frequently, when the fire burns
dim and badly, a very small quantity of very finely powdered
charcoal or lampblack will make it perfect.</p>

<p class="center">OF PORTABLE FIRE-WORKS.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. I. Of exhibitions on Tables.</i></p>

<p>Fire-works, it is obvious, may be employed in a variety
of ways, either large or small, in the open air, or in apartments,
according to circumstances. <i>Fire-tables</i> are composed
of a great many works, the same as is exhibited upon
a large scale; but of a size corresponding with small exhibitions.
As <i>fire-tables</i> are used only in apartments, and the
works are shown from tables, on which they are arranged, it
is necessary that the cases which contain them should be of
a small caliber, and their fire less extensive.</p>

<p>The cases or cartridges are made of one-eighth of an inch
in diameter, and charged with the best pistol powder, which
produces less <i>smoke</i> than cannon powder. These small works
are usually exhibited on <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'pastebord'">pasteboard</ins>, differently arranged.</p>

<p>Among the works are frequently figures, resembling fruit
contained in <i>gerbes</i> and even small <i>caprices</i>. <i>Pinks</i>, which
are also used, are generally modified, or accompanied with
other decorations, and furnished with illuminated suns.
<i>Fire-pots</i> of one inch in diameter, filled with small <i>bombs</i> and
various devices, are employed, when a <i>surprise</i> is intended.
The fire-table is arranged, although upon a small scale, in
the same manner as other works. Their arrangement,
therefore, is the same as for other kinds of fire-works, only
proportioning them accordingly.</p>

<p class="p1">As to <i>aquatic fire-works</i>, some of which are frequently
shown in rooms, the reader will find in the article on that
subject, a full account of the manner of forming them. He
may also consult a treatise on <cite>Artificial fire-works</cite> by Perrint
D'Orval, published in 1745. This work gives ample instructions
for performing all kinds of fire-work on water.</p>

<p>In the article alluded to will be found several formulæ for
preparing odoriferous fire, which may be used for exhibitions
on the table. The succeeding chapter, however, is sufficiently
comprehensive on that subject.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="TROx" id="TROx"></a><i>Sec. II. Of Table Rockets.</i></p>

<p>Table rockets are not calculated for exhibition. They are
designed merely to show the truth of driving, and the judgment
of a fire-worker. They have no other effect, when fired,
than spinning round in the same place where they began, till
they are burnt out, and showing a horizontal circle of fire.
The method of making these rockets, is the following: Have
a cone, turned out of solid wood, 2<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches in diameter,
and of the same height, and, round its base, draw a line.
On this line, fix four spokes, two inches long each, so as to
stand one opposite the other; then fill four nine-inch one
pound cases with any strong composition, within two inches
of the top. These cases are made like tourbillons, and must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
be rammed with the greatest exactness. The rockets being
filled, fix their open ends on the short spokes; then, in the
side of each case, bore a hole near the clay. All these holes
or vents must be so made, that the fire of each case may act
the same way; and from these vents carry leaders to the top
of the cone, and tie them together. When the rockets are to
be fixed, set them on a smooth table, and light the leaders in
the middle, and all the cases will fire together, and spin on
the point of the cone. These rockets may be made to rise,
like tourbillons, by making the cases shorter, and boring four
holes in the under side of each, at equal distances. This being
done, they are called double tourbillons.</p>

<p>All the vents in the under sides of the cases, must be
lighted at once; and the sharp point of the cone cut off, at
which place, it is to be made spherical.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sect. III. Of the Transparent Illuminated Table Star.</i></p>

<p>The table star is usually twelve feet in diameter, and,
from the nearest extremity to the frame, four feet. This
proportion, observed on each side, will make the centre
frame four feet square. In this square, a transparent star is
fixed. This star may be painted blue, and its rays made
like the flaming stars. The wheels for this star may be
composed of different coloured fires, with a charge or two of
slow fire. The wheels, on the extremities, may be clothed
with any number of cases; so that the star-wheel consists of
the same. The illuminated fires, which must be placed very
near each other on the frames, in order to have a proper effect,
ought to burn as long as the wheels, and be lighted at
the same time.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="DETx" id="DETx"></a><i>Sect. IV. Of Detonating Works.</i></p>

<p>We have noticed various fulminating preparations in different
parts of our work, such as the ordinary fulminating
powder, Higgins's fulminating powder, fulminating oil, and
several metallic powders. We have also given some preparations
made with fulminating silver, the making of which we
have noticed.</p>

<p>Besides the torpedo, &amp;c. prepared with fulminating silver,
there are some other preparations made with the same substance,
which we purpose to give in this place.</p>

<p><a name="WATx" id="WATx"></a>
<i>Waterloo crackers.</i> Take a slip of cartridge paper, about
three-quarters of an inch in width, paste and double it. Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
it remain till dry, and cut it into two equal <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'parts &nbsp; length'">parts in length</ins>,
(No. 1 and 2), according to the following pattern.</p>

<p class="p1" />
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdc wd20">No. 1.</td><td class="tdc wd20">Glass.</td><td class="tdc wd10">S.</td><td class="tdc wd20">Glass.</td><td class="tdc wd20">No. 2.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="p1">Take some of the glass composition, and lay it across the
paper as in the pattern, and put about a quarter of a grain
of fulminating silver in the place marked S.; and, while the
glass composition is moist, put the paper, marked No. 2,
over the farthest row of glass. Over all, paste, twice over
the part that covers the silver, a piece of paper; let it dry.
By pulling both ends apart, the friction by the glass, will
cause the fulminating silver to explode.</p>

<p><i>Detonating Girdle.</i> Procure a piece of girth, from 12 to
18 inches in length. Double it, and fold it down about 1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>
inches, similar to the fold of a letter, and then turn back one
end of the girth, and it will form two compartments. Then
dissolve some gum arabic in water, and thicken it by adding
coarsely powdered glass. Place two upright rows of the
glass composition, in the inside of one of the folds, about
a quarter of an inch in width, and, when they are dry, sow
the first fold together on the edge, and then the second at the
opposite end; so that one end may be open. Then in the
centre of the two rows, put about a grain of fulminating silver,
and paste a piece of cotton or silk over it. Make a hole
at each end of the girdle, and hang it to a hook in the door
post, and the other hook on the door; observing to place the
silk part, so that it may come against the edge of the door
upon being opened, which will occasion a report.</p>

<p><i>Detonating Tape.</i> This is made of binding, about <span class="xs"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>ths of
an inch in width. The same directions are to be attended
to, as those we have just given for making the girdle. It
may be exploded by taking hold of each end, and rolling the
ends from each other sharply, or by two persons pulling at
opposite ends.</p>

<p><i>Detonating Balls.</i> These are made in several ways, either
by enclosing a shot in paper with fulminating silver, which
is exploded by throwing it on the ground, or made of small
glass globes. For the latter, procure some small glass globes,
between the size of a pea and a small marble, in which there
must be a small hole; put into it half a grain of fulminating
silver, and paste a piece of paper over the hole. When this
ball is put on the ground, and trod upon, it will go off with
a loud noise. If put under the leg of a chair, and pressed by
the weight of the body, the same effect will take place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Detonating Cards.</i> Take a piece of card, about three
fourths of an inch in breadth and 12 in length; slit it at one
end, and place in the opening a quarter of a grain of fulminating
silver, close the end down with a little paste, and when
dry light the end in a candle.</p>

<p>Fulminating silver may be used in several other ways,
affording a variety in the effect, as the following: Fold a letter
in the usual manner, and along with the wafer introduce
the fulminating silver mixed with some glass: when the
wafer is broken, in the act of opening the letter, a violent
explosion will take place.</p>

<p>By placing a quarter of a grain of the powder in the midst
of some tobacco in a pipe, or between the leaves of a segar,
and closing the end again to prevent the powder from falling
out; it need hardly be stated, that on lighting it, an explosion
ensues. Such experiments should be made with
caution.</p>

<p>One-third of a grain of fulminating silver, folded in a small
piece of paper, and wrapped in another piece, then pasted
round a pin, which is to be stuck in the wick of a candle,
will make a loud report.</p>

<p>As fulminating silver explodes by heat, or friction, it is
obvious, that various contrivances may be used for this purpose.
If, for instance, half a grain be put on a piece of
<i>glass paper</i>, (paper covered with a mixture of powdered
glass and gum), then inclosed in a piece of tin foil, and put
in the bottom or side of a drawer; on opening or shutting
it, the powder will immediately explode. The same effect
takes place by putting a quarter of a grain into a piece of
paper, and placing it in the snuffers. When the candle is
snuffed, it will go off.</p>

<p>Two figures, one of which blows out and the other relights
a candle, are sometimes exhibited in rooms. This is
performed by making two figures of any shape or material,
and inserting in the mouth of one, a small tube, at the end
of which is a piece of phosphorus, and in the mouth of the
other, a tube containing at the end a few grains of gunpowder;
observing that each be retained in the tube by a piece
of paper. If the second figure be applied to the flame of a
taper, it will extinguish it, by reason of the gunpowder, and
the first will light it again.</p>

<p><i>Candle bombs.</i> These are usually called candle crackers,
and are made of glass. They are blown in small bubbles,
having a neck about half an inch long, with very slender
bores, by means of which a small quantity of water or spirit
of wine is introduced. The orifice is then closed. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
they are stuck into a candle, the heat converts the water or
alcohol into vapour, which <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'breakes'">breaks</ins> the glass with a loud report,
extinguishing the flame at the same time.</p>

<p><i>Detonations by Electricity.</i> The electric fluid, it is known,
will inflame combustible bodies, and, for the purpose of experiment,
several contrivances have been used. That of
placing the substance, gunpowder for instance, on a small insulated
stand, and passing the spark through it by means of
conductors, will cause its inflammation. The <i>electrical house</i>
is also an exemplification of the effect of the electric fluid.</p>

<p><i>Detonations by Galvanism.</i> Substances, placed on a glass
plate, and brought in contact with the positive and negative
poles of a galvanic battery, are readily inflamed. Hence
phosphorus, gunpowder, the metals, &amp;c. may be inflamed
in this manner. The deflagrator of professor Hare of the
University of Pennsylvania, is a powerful apparatus for the
purpose; for the construction of which, and the details of its
effects, see the American Journal of Science by professor
Silliman, of Yale College.</p>

<p>Among the means of producing heat that of compression
is well known. The common condensing syringe, for inflaming
spunk or touch paper, is on this principle.</p>

<p>This syringe is now made very portable, not more than
six inches in length and about three-eighths of an inch in diameter.
The end of the piston, which fits tight in the cylinder,
has a small cavity, in which the spunk is put, so that,
when the piston is suddenly compressed, the air is condensed,
and a temperature produced, sufficient to inflame it. The
air, in the cylinder, is condensed in the ratio of about one to
forty. The calculations on the degree of compression, which
atmospheric air must undergo to produce fire by this kind of
percussion, with observations on the subject, may be seen in
M. Biot, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de Physique Experimentale, &amp;c.</cite> tome ii,
p. 17), with other remarks concerning the sources of caloric.</p>

<p>To account for certain phenomena in the atmosphere, some
of which are accompanied with detonations, Mr. Nicholson
(<cite>Chemical Dictionary</cite>, article Air, atmospherical), conceives
that the lower atmosphere consists chiefly of oxygen and nitrogen,
together with moisture, and the occasional vapours
or exhalations of bodies. The upper atmosphere seems to
be composed of a large proportion of hydrogen, a fluid of so
much less specific gravity than any other, that it must naturally
ascend to the highest place; where, being occasionally
set on fire by electricity, it appears to be the cause of the
aurora borealis and fire-balls. It may easily be understood,
that this will only happen on the confines of the re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>spective
masses of common atmospherical air, and of the inflammable
air; that the combustion will extend progressively,
though rapidly, in flashings from the place where it commences;
and that, when, by any means, a stream of inflammable
air, in its progress towards the upper atmosphere, is
set on fire at one end, its ignition may be much more rapid
than what happens higher up, where oxygen is wanting; and
at the same time more definite in its figure and progression,
so as to form the appearance of a fire-ball.</p>

<p>Detonations frequently accompany combustion. There
are many interesting experiments on this subject, some of
which we will notice in this place, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p><i>Experiment 1.</i> If a small portion of fulminating powder be
placed on a fire-shovel over a hot fire, it will become brown,
then melt, and swell up, and finally explode. See <a href="#FULz"><i>Fulminating
powder</i>.</a></p>

<p><i>Experiment 2.</i> Iron filings and sulphur, made into a paste
with water, and buried in the ground for a few hours, will
unite, decompose the water, and inflame; throwing up the
earth with violence and noise. See <a href="#ARVx"><i>Artificial <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Volcono'">Volcano</ins></i>.</a></p>

<p><i>Experiment 3.</i> If nitrate of copper be spread on tin foil
and wetted, and the foil immediately wrapped up, scintillations
of fire will follow, accompanied with slight detonations.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 4.</i> Five or six grains of sulphuret of antimony,
with half its weight of chlorate of potassa, when struck
with a hammer will cause a loud detonation.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 5.</i> Two grains of chlorate of potassa, and one
grain of flowers of sulphur, when rubbed together, will produce

one grain of phosphorus, and drop the mixture into sulphuric
acid; detonation and flame will be the consequence.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 8.</i> Make a mixture of arsenic and chlorate of
potassa. On presenting a lighted match, combustion, accompanied
with a detonation, will ensue; and, if a train of gunpowder
be laid, and both inflamed at the same time, the
arsenical mixture will burn with the rapidity of lightning,
while the other burns with comparative slowness.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 9.</i> If one grain of dry nitrate of bismuth be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
mixed with one grain of phosphorus, and rubbed together in
a metallic mortar, a loud detonation will be produced.</p>

water, an instantaneous explosion will be produced.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 11.</i> A grain of fulminating gold, struck gently
with a hammer, will produce a loud explosion.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 12.</i> A few grains of fulminating mercury,
struck in the same manner, will produce a loud detonation.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 13.</i> When a grain or two of potassium are
mixed with the same quantity of sodium, no effect will take
place; but if the mixture be brought in contact with a globule
of mercury, and agitated, combustion, with a slight detonation,
will follow, showing the vivid combustion of three
metals, when brought in contact with each other.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 14.</i> If to six grains of chlorate of potassa, we
add three grains of pulverized charcoal, and rub the two in
a mortar, no effect will ensue; but if we add to this mixture
two grains of sulphur, and continue the rubbing, inflammation,
accompanied with a report, will take place. See <a href="#GUNy"><i>Gunpowder
of chlorate of potassa</i>.</a></p>

<p><i>Experiment 15.</i> Chlorate of potassa and sulphur, rubbed
in a mortar, will produce a crackling noise, similar to that of
a whip. These reports will follow in <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'sucession'">succession</ins> as the pestle
is pressed on the mixture.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 16.</i> Combustion, with a slight detonation,
takes place during the melting of coin in a nut-shell. For
this purpose, make a mixture of three parts of nitre, one part
of sulphur, and one of very fine dry saw dust; press a small
portion of this powder into a walnut shell, and put on it a
small silver or copper coin, rolled up, and fill the shell with
the mixture. If the mixture be now inflamed, it will melt
the coin in a mass, while the shell will be only blackened.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 17.</i> Introduce, into an inflammable air pistol,
a mixture of hydrogen gas with oxygen gas, or, in the place
of the latter, atmospheric air, and apply a lighted taper: a
violent detonation will be produced. See <a href="#FIRy"><i>Inflammable air
works</i>.</a></p>

<p><i>Experiment 18.</i> Mix some fine musket powder with

an anvil; the gunpowder will explode. See <a href="#GUNx"><i>Gunpowder</i>.</a></p>

<p><i>Experiment 19.</i> Take a small portion of fulminating
platinum, and place it on the end of a spatula, or on the
blade of a knife, and hold it over the flame of a candle; a
sharp explosion will take place. See <a href="#FULy"><i>Fulminating platinum</i>.</a></p>

<p><i>Experiment 20.</i> If soap bubbles be formed of a mixture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
hydrogen gas and atmospheric air, and touched with a lighted
taper, they will detonate in the air.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 21.</i> If a portion of detonating oil, (<i>Chloride
of azote</i>) be heated to 212°, a violent explosion will ensue; or,</p>

<p><i>Experiment 22.</i> If a portion of the same oil, of the
size of a pin-head, be brought in contact with olive oil, the
effect will be still more violent. See <a href="#DETy"><i>Detonating oil</i>.</a></p>

<p><i>Experiment 23.</i> Take ten or fifteen grains of <i>Higgins's</i>
fulminating powder, and expose it to heat on a shovel: detonation
will follow. See <a href="#INFy"><i>Higgins's Fulminating powder</i>.</a></p>

<p><i>Experiment 24.</i> If oxalate of mercury, to the amount of
three or four grains, be struck with a hammer, a detonation
will ensue, in the same manner as with the nitrous etherized
oxalate of mercury, or Howard's fulminating mercury.
See <a href="#FULx"><i>Mercury</i>.</a></p>

<p><i>Experiment 25.</i> Take some of the detonating powder,
prepared from indigo, and wrap it up in paper, and strike
the paper with a hammer: an explosion will ensue. See <a href="#DETz"><i>Detonating
powder from indigo</i>.</a></p>

<p><i>Experiment 26.</i> If some gunpowder be placed on the
stand of an electrical discharger, and the electric spark passed
through it, combustion, with a detonation, will be produced.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 27.</i> If some gunpowder be wrapped in tin
foil, and placed on a glass plate, and the two wires of a galvanic
battery brought in contact with the foil; the foil will
inflame and explode the powder.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 28.</i> Mix in a mortar one part of sulphuret of
potassa with two parts of nitrate of potassa, and expose the
mixture to the action of heat in the same manner as fulminating
powder: a violent detonation will take place. The sulphuret
of potassa is recommended, in lieu of potassa and
sulphur in a separate state; and although called Bergman's
fulminating powder, this compound is in fact, according to
the theory of its explosion, the same as the ordinary fulminating
powder.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 29.</i> If, says Morey, (<cite>Silliman's Journal</cite> ii,
21), a given quantity of strongly compressed boiling water,
be suddenly discharged into about an equal quantity of oil
or rosin, at or near the boiling point, it will explode, to
every appearance, as quickly and violently as gunpowder.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 30.</i> If zinc or iron filings, or pulverized antimony,
be mixed with chlorate of potassa, and struck with
a hammer, violent detonations will ensue. If sulphuret of
iron be used, the same effect will ensue. See MM. Four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>croy
and Vauquelin's communication to the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Société Philomatique</cite>,
in their <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Transactions</cite>.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 31.</i> If oxide of mercury, obtained from its
solution in nitric acid by means of caustic potassa, be dried,
and mixed with flowers of sulphur, and struck with a hammer,
a detonation will be produced. (See <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de Physique</cite>,
1779.)</p>

<p><i>Experiment 32.</i> If alcohol or ether be mixed with chlorate
of potassa, into a thick paste, and the mixture struck
with a hammer, an explosion will be the consequence: or,</p>

<p><i>Experiment 33.</i> If, instead of alcohol or ether, we make
use of fixed or volatile oils, and proceed in the same manner,
the same effect will ensue.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 34.</i> If a small portion of chloride of azote
(<i>Detonating oil</i>) be dropped into a solution of phosphorus
in ether or alcohol, a violent explosion will take place: or,</p>

<p><i>Experiment 35.</i> If in the place of phosphorized ether,
other oils, as camphorated oil, palm oil, whale oil, linseed
oil, sulphuretted oil, oil of turpentine, naphtha, &amp;c. be brought
in contact, the same effect will ensue.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 36.</i> Chloride of azote will also detonate with
sundry gaseous and solid substances, as supersulphuretted
hydrogen, sulphuretted hydrogen, phosphuretted hydrogen,
nitrous gas, aqueous ammonia, phosphuret of lime, ambergris,
fused potassa, and sundry metallic soaps. Messrs. Porret,
Wilson, and Kirk, brought one hundred and twenty-five substances
in contact with it, and twenty-eight of the number
produced detonations. (<cite>Nicholson's Journal</cite>, vol. 34.)</p>

<p><i>Experiment 37.</i> If a small quantity of ammoniacal nitrate
of copper be wrapped in paper, or in a piece of tin foil, and
struck with a hammer, a detonation will ensue.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 38.</i> If a small portion of arsenic and chlorate
of potassa be mixed, and smartly struck, a flame will be produced,
accompanied with an explosion; or,</p>

<p><i>Experiment 39.</i> If the same mixture be touched with a
lighted match, it will burn with considerable rapidity; or,</p>

<p><i>Experiment 40.</i> If it be thrown into concentrated sulphuric
acid, at the instant of contact, a flame will rise into the
air like a flash of lightning.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 41.</i> Heat a portion of deutoxide of chlorine:
when the temperature arrives at 212°, an explosion will take
place, and chlorine and oxygen be evolved.</p>

<p><a name="EXPx" id="EXPx"></a><i>Experiment 42.</i> If prussine gas, otherwise called cyanogen,
or carburet of azote, be mixed with atmospheric air, in
the proportion of about one to four in volume, and the elec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>tric
spark made to pass through the mixture; a violent detonation
will result, leaving a mixture of carbonic acid gas
and azotic gas.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 43.</i> If a mixture of equal parts of nitrate of
potassa, and titanium, be thrown into a red-hot crucible, detonation
will follow.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 44.</i> Melt some nitrate of potassa in a crucible,
and bring it to the state of ignition: now throw in a small
quantity of pulverized zinc, and a very violent detonation
will take place.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 45.</i> If one part of zinc filings and two parts of
dry arsenic acid be distilled in a retort, or exposed to heat
in a crucible, the moment it becomes red, a detonation will
be produced.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 46.</i> If a few drops of deutoxide of hydrogen,
or the oxygenized water of Thenard, be let fall on dry oxide
of silver, a violent action will follow, accompanied with
an explosion. Several other oxides have the same effect.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 47.</i> If a portion of black wadd, an ore of manganese
found in Derbyshire, England, be brought in contact
with linseed oil; the oil will take fire, producing sometimes
slight detonations.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 48.</i> Take a portion of the brown oxide of tungsten,
formed by transmitting hydrogen gas over tungstic
acid, in an ignited glass tube; mix it with chlorate of potassa,
and strike the mixture with a hammer: a loud detonation
will ensue; or,</p>

<p><i>Experiment 49.</i> Heat some of the brown oxide in the air.
It will take fire, and burn like tinder, passing to the state of
the yellow oxide, or tungstic acid.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 50.</i> If one measure of oxygen gas, and two
measures of hydrogen gas be mixed in the explosive eudiometer,
and the electric spark passed through them, a detonation
will ensue, and a complete condensation take place.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 51.</i> When equal volumes of protoxide of azote,
or gaseous oxide of azote, (called also nitrous oxide),
and hydrogen gas, are treated in the same manner, the mixture
will explode, leaving a residuum, consisting of azotic
gas.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 52.</i> If two measures of carbonic oxide or gaseous
oxide of carbon, and one measure of oxygen, be submitted
to the action of the electric spark, a detonation will
ensue, and the carbonic oxide will be changed into carbonic
acid.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 53.</i> If one measure of carburetted hydrogen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
gas, either the heavy or light carburetted hydrogen, called
also the hydroguret and bi-hydroguret of carbon, (the former
being sometimes called olefiant gas), be mixed with two
or three measures of oxygen gas, and the electric spark transmitted
through them; a detonation will ensue, forming water
and carbonic acid.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 54.</i> If one measure of cyanogen, (carburet
of azote), be mixed with two and a half measures of oxygen
gas, and treated with the electric spark, the mixed gases
will explode very loudly. The cyanogen burns, in this case,
with a blue flame; although it is usually of a purple colour.
The products of combustion are carbonic acid and azote. (See
<a href="#EXPx">Experiment 42.</a>)</p>

<p><i>Experiment 55.</i> If one measure of arsenuretted hydrogen
gas, (obtained from an alloy of three parts of tin and one of
arsenic, by treating it with muriatic acid), and two measures
of oxygen gas are mixed together, and the electric spark is passed
through the mixture; a detonation will ensue, and water
and arsenious acid be formed.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 56.</i> If potassium be made to act upon a compound
of chlorine and sulphur, called chloride of sulphur, an
explosion will immediately ensue; but,</p>

<p><i>Experiment 57.</i> If potassium be dropped into chlorine gas,
inflammation only will take place, accompanied with a vivid
light, forming chloride of potassium, (dry muriate of potassa.)</p>

<p><i>Experiment 58.</i> If sulphuret of potassium be heated in the
air, it will burn with great brilliancy, forming sulphate of potassa;
but, if mixed with chlorate of potassa, and struck with
a hammer, a violent detonation will be produced.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 59.</i> If potassium be heated in sulphuretted hydrogen
gas, it takes fire, and burns with a vivid flame, and
pure hydrogen is set free; thus proving that sulphuretted hydrogen
gas, although inflammable itself in oxygen gas, is a
supporter of combustion for potassium.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 60.</i> If phosphuret of potassium be exposed
to the air, it will inflame spontaneously, forming phosphate
of potassa; but if it be dropped into water, it will produce a
violent explosion, in consequence of the immediate disengagement
of phosphuretted hydrogen gas.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 61.</i> If potassium be moderately heated in the
air, it inflames, burns with a red light, and emits alkaline
fumes.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 62.</i> If potassium be thrown upon water, it
acts with great violence, burning with a beautiful light, of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
red colour, mixed with purple, the water becoming a solution
of potassa.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 63.</i> When sodium is heated strongly in oxygen
or chlorine, it burns with great brilliancy; but it does not
inflame, when thrown into water. It is converted, however,
into soda. If it be heated in oxygen gas in excess, it burns,
and is converted into the peroxide of sodium, which, when
mixed with combustible bodies, and exposed to the action of
heat, deflagrates with violence, giving off its excess of oxygen,
and becoming changed into soda, or protoxide of sodium.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 64.</i> When sulphuret of sodium is mixed with
chlorate of potassa, and struck with a hammer, a detonation
will ensue; and when sodium is heated nearly to fusion, in
contact with sulphuretted hydrogen gas, it will unite with
the sulphur; flame will be produced, and hydrogen gas set at
liberty. A sulphuret of sodium is thus formed, which is
usually combined with some sulphuretted hydrogen.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 65.</i> When a mixture of ammoniacal gas, in a
dry state, and oxygen gas, is submitted to the influence of
the electric spark, in the explosive eudiometer, explosion
will take place, and water and azotic gas result.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 66.</i> If potassium or sodium be heated in fluoric
gas, a rapid combustion takes place, in all respects as
brilliant as in oxygen gas.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 67.</i> If gallic acid be placed on a red-hot iron,
it burns with flame, and emits an aromatic smell, similar to
that of benzoic acid; but, if mixed with chlorate of potassa
and struck with a <i>hot</i> hammer, a detonation will ensue. Various
vegetable acids, as the benzoic, which is highly inflammable,
produce similar effects.</p>

<p class="center"><a name="SCEx" id="SCEx"></a>OF SCENTED FIRE-WORKS.</p>


<p>There is a variety of scented fires, all partaking, in a
greater or lesser degree, of a peculiar flavour, according to
the substances, which enter into their composition. It is a
fact, that, in the ordinary odoriferous fire, into which, either
the so called scented gums, or essential oils, enter as a component
part, these substances are not only decomposed in the
act of combustion, but evolve, during that process, a part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
their respective <i>odours</i>, to which we attribute the <i>scent</i> imparted
to the atmosphere. In those instances, in which gunpowder
forms a part of the composition, it is to be remarked,
that the peculiar smell of fired gunpowder is
scarcely recognized, owing to the preponderance of the scent
in the composition. Hence it is, that scented fire-works are
more calculated for confined places than for the open air.</p>

<p>Scented fires are various both in their nature and composition,
and may always be so modified, as, in their effect, to
produce, not only the particular flame, or appearance of the
fire, but the extrication, along with the gaseous products, of
the odour of the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'esssential'">essential</ins> oil, or other substance made
use of.</p>

<p>Linnæus, in a dissertation on the odours of different substances,
endeavoured to classify them. M. Lorrey (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires
de la Société Royale de Medicine</cite> 1784) divided them
into five classes; viz. camphors, narcotics, ethers, volatile
acids, and alkalies; but it is obvious, that it is an impossibility
to class all the odours which exist, and may be formed
by the mixture, or combination of various substances. We
may consider them either pleasant, or unpleasant to the sense
of smelling. But as we recognize bodies very frequently by
their odour, with which we become familiar, as camphor and
assafœtida, for instance; so the olfactories may be affected by
other odours. Aromatic and fetid odours are opposite to
each other. Some of the gases, as the olefiant, have a fragrant
smell, and others, as hydrogen, and sulphuretted hydrogen,
either alone or mixed, are extremely unpleasant.
The intestinal gas (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gas intestinaux</i> of the French) is a particular
instance of the odour of a compound gas, or mixture
of gaseous fluids. The experiments of M. Jurine of Geneva,
of MM. Chevreul and Magendie, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ann. de Chim. et de
Phys.</cite> t. ii, 294), of M. Vauquelin, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de Pharmacie</cite>,
t. iii, p. 205), and of MM. Lameyran and Fremy, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bulletin
de Pharmacie</cite>, t. 1, p. 358), are interesting on this subject. Intestinal
gas differs in its composition. It always contains
carbonic acid gas, and azotic gas, and hydrogen gas, either
pure, or combined with carbon and sulphur. Thenard (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité
de Chimie</cite>, iii, p. 576) contains some observations on this
subject.</p>

<p>In the camphor odour, Lorrey includes not only camphor
itself, but various species of laurel, myrrh, and turpentine.
In the narcotic odour, he embraces opium, various gum-resins,
roses, lillies, jessamine, &amp;c. and musk, amber, and cas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>tor.
In the ethereal odour, different kinds of ether. Under
the odour of volatile acids, he considers that of fruits, aromatic
barks, citron; and under the alkaline odour, the acrid, and,
in general, the antiscorbutic plants. Fourcroy, in treating
of the aroma of plants, or the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spiritus rector</i> of Boerhaave,
(<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bulletin de la Société Philomatique</cite>, an. 6, p. 52,) has some
interesting facts on this subject.</p>

<p>It is evident, that perfumes, so called, owe their peculiar
fragrance to an essential oil, which characterizes each kind;
for the essential oil obtained by distillation, partakes of the
odour of the plant. Hence the oils of mint, roses, thyme,
cinnamon, cloves, &amp;c. &amp;c. all of which are peculiar in this
respect. Odoriferous fire-works owe their particular properties
to the presence of some gum, resin, or oil. As to the
expansibility, or rather the divisibility of odour, several interesting
facts are known. In a work, entitled <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l'Existence de
Dieu, par les merveilles de la Nature</cite>, we are informed, that,
if we take the one-fourth of a drachm of benzoin, and place
it in the four corners of a room, the odour will be recognised
in an instant. The chamber in which the experiment was
made, the author states, was 24 feet by 16, and contained
9212 cubic feet of air, which, multiplied by 1000, would give
9216000 inches, and 1000000 parts of an inch were rendered
appreciable. Therefore, he infers, that 9216000000000 are
equally perceptible in the chamber. Prevot (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bulletin de
la Société Philomatique</cite>, an. 6) has some observations of
the same nature, respecting camphor. If such are the effects
with benzoin, what, we may ask, would be those of the
more powerful perfumes, such as musk? One grain, or perhaps
the tenth part of a grain of musk, would scent the atmosphere
of a room very perfectly.</p>

<p>De Laval (<cite>Description of the Maldiva Islands</cite>) mentions
the use of scented fire by the inhabitants, in the celebration
of their festivals. On the day of every new moon, they
place at the entrance of the churches, and the gates of their
houses, cocoa shells cut in the middle, and filled with white
sand and burning coals, upon which they burn, almost all
night, sweet scented gums and woods; and at the nocturnal
festival, called <i>maulude</i>, the night on which Mahomet died,
their halls are illuminated with a multitude of lamps, and
the air is filled with the smoke of perfumes. The use of
scented fire appears to form a principal part of their devotional
exercises. Perfumes are even burnt on the graves of
deceased persons.</p>

<p>Having mentioned the use of odoriferous plants in scented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
fire, we may add, that all plants possess some peculiar character,
if aromatic, which, as one of their characters, serves
to distinguish them.</p>

<p>The qualities of plants are said to be similar, when they
have the same taste and odour. The odours of plants, Richard
divides into 1. Fragrant, 2. Aromatic, 3. Ambrosiac, or
resembling amber, 4. Alliaceous, or resembling garlic, 5.
Fetid, 6. Nauseous. The three first are innoxious.</p>

<p>In the composition of scented fire-works, it is also to be
observed, that gunpowder does not always form a part; and
hence their character is various, according to the purposes
they are applied to, or their uses.</p>

<p>In the odoriferous water balloons, (for which, see <a href="#AQUx"><i>aquatic
fire-works</i></a>), we have, for instance, along with saltpetre and
other substances, in the different compositions, either amber
and flowers of benzoin; or frankincense, myrrh, and camphor;
or amber, cedar raspings, and the essential oils of roses and
bergamot; or the saw-dust of juniper, cypress, camphor,
myrrh, dried rosemary, cortex elaterii, and oil of roses.
These are the substances, therefore, which enter into the different
compositions, in the order here given, and which impart
to the fire an odoriferous character. The relative proportions
may be learnt, by referring to the chapter on <i>Aquatic
fire-works</i>.</p>

<p>Scented fires are, however, little used. Their effect is nevertheless
agreeable in close rooms; but in the open air they
lose this property, or rather it is not perceptible, owing to
its extreme division.</p>

<p>The <i>vases of scent</i> were greatly employed in the public
feasts and ceremonies at Rome, Athens, and, above all, in
Egypt. In temples, palaces, &amp;c. they were mostly used.
The vessels, which contained the composition, were placed
by the Athenians in sculptured or painted vases, as well to
hide their appearance, as to serve for ornament.</p>

<p>Pastilles, or fire crayons, are small conical troches, in the
form of a loaf, of one and a quarter inches in height, and
about an inch thick. They are made of the following composition,
which is moistened with rose-water, having some
gum arabic previously dissolved in it. The paste is made
neither too thick nor too thin, but of a sufficient consistence
to work with the hand.</p>

<p class="p1">These substances are pulverized, and intimately mixed,
and oil of juniper is added. The mixture is put in an earthen
vessel, having a cotton, similar to a wick, supported by
means of a wire. Among the ancients, the earthen vessels
were afterwards placed in sculptured, or otherwise ornamented
vases. By using stone-ware vessels, and mixing the
composition with the spirit or oil of turpentine, the combustion
will be more rapid, and the flame more enlarged.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. III. Remarks on Spontaneous Accension.</i></p>

<p>The spontaneous accension of spirit of turpentine by the

a scented fire extemporaneously; by putting into the

above mentioned. See <a href="#NITz"><i>Nitric Acid</i></a>, in the article <a href="#NITw"><i>Nitre</i>.</a></p>

<p>An extemporaneous fire may also be prepared, by placing,
on the scented mixture, the following composition, namely,
chlorate, or hyperoxymuriate, of potassa and sugar, and
touching the mixture with a glass rod dipped in sulphuric
acid, or oil of vitriol. The fire will then communicate to the

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. IV. Of Torches, and Odoriferous Flambeaux.</i></p>

<p>Flambeaux are usually wax torches. Odoriferous flambeaux
may be formed by melting with the wax, camphor and
frankincense, and mixing with the whole, when fluid, some
of the essence of bergamot. Although there are no directions
given on that subject; yet, judging from analogy, a
mixture of that kind would be an improvement on the flambeau,
when it is to be used in rooms or for particular occasions.
They may be made either large or small, with a wick
of a proportionate size.</p>

<p>Torches are principally used for military purposes, to give
light, when an army is marching at night, during sieges, &amp;c.
They ought not to be extinguished by wind or rain. The
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Torches inextinguibles</i>, of the French, are of this character.</p>

<p>Torches are made in the following manner: Take four
large cotton matches, three or four feet long; boil them in a
solution of saltpetre, and arrange them round a pine stick.
Afterwards, cover them with priming powder and sulphur,
made into a thin paste with brandy. When dry, they are to
be covered with the following composition:</p>

<p class="p1">The second composition is that which is used in France,
and, therefore, in all likelihood, is the best formula. The
flame may be more or less scented, by using, at the same
time, some of the aromatic substances before noticed. This,
however, is unnecessary for common purposes. See <a href="#MILy"><i>Fire-works

<p class="centerx"><a name="ODOx" id="ODOx"></a><i>Sec. V. Remarks concerning Odoriferous and Fetid Fire.</i></p>

<p>Fire-works may be made extremely unpleasant to the olfactory
nerves, by mixing with their compositions, sundry
substances of an opposite quality to odoriferous oils and aromatic
gums. It will be sufficient, however, to remark, that
this effect is communicated more particularly, as in the <i>stink-balls</i>
of service, by using sulphur, rasped horses' and asses'
hoofs, burnt in the fire, assafœtida, seraphim gum, and
sundry fetid herbs or plants. The addition of the acid of
amber, called succinnic acid, and, in the shops, the <i>salt of
amber</i>, will give to the atmosphere in the vicinity of the fire,
the peculiar property of causing a continual sneezing and
coughing. Such are some of the opposite effects, which different
substances produce in conjunction with fire-works.
Some of these substances, it is obvious, would, if used in
too large a proportion, retard, if not entirely prevent the
combustion; and for that reason, they bear only a given proportion
to the powder, nitre and charcoal, which forms the
basis of some, as, for instance, the <i>stink-ball</i> composition.
But in such cases, the combustion being in itself rapid, and
the degree of heat consequently proportionate, these fixed,
and otherwise incombustible bodies, in a general sense, are
acted upon by the fire, already created; and, therefore, the
smoke that results must necessarily possess, and partake of
the fetid qualities of the substances employed. On the same
principle, we may account for the effect of the scented paste,
and the scented vases; but with this difference, that many of
those substances are themselves inflammable, and, during
their decomposition, emit the odour peculiar to each of them.
We know, that the elementary principles of these bodies are
carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, variously combined, some of
which are, and some are not inflammable; and that, in combustion,
when it takes place, they are decomposed and new
products necessarily ensue from a new arrangement of the
elementary principles.</p>

<p>It is difficult, however, to give the precise order in which
decompositions by fire result; since the substances made use
of are numerous and employed in given proportions; and
since their action upon each other, depends frequently on
external agents, anomalous circumstances, and causes which
do not follow at all times the same order of succession.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Generally speaking, however, we may obtain such a datum,
all things being considered, a datum derived from the known
laws of chemical decomposition, as will furnish a <i>rationale</i>
to explain both the cause and effect. See <a href="#GENx"><i>General Theory of
Fire-works</i>.</a></p>

<p>There is no doubt, that, by the action of fire on fetid, and
particularly animal, substances, as <i>hoofs</i>, &amp;c. products may
be formed in the very act of combustion, which would increase
the fetid properties of the smoke. Zimome, obtained
from the gluten of wheat by alcohol, which takes up the
gliadine, when thrown upon red-hot coals, exhales an odour,
similar to that of burning hair or hoofs, and burns with
flame. The <i>pyro-products</i> are the immediate consequences
of the decomposition of the substance; the elements of
which either separate entirely, or recombine under some
other form, as we find in the process of destructive distillation.</p>

<p>Bones, and other hard parts of animals, when subjected to
distillation, furnish several products, as impure ammonia, animal
oil, and the like. Wood also, we remarked, when treating
of its carbonization for the formation of coal, produces,
besides gaseous and other volatile products, the result of its
decomposition, a quantity of acid liquor, formerly called the
pyroligneous, but now the pyroacetic acid. By separating
the empyreumatic flavour, which at first constitutes a part of
the acid, the acetic acid is obtained in a state of purity.
The pyro-tartaric acid is also the result of the action of
heat; and we know, when animal substances are calcined
with potash, they produce cyanogen, the basis of the hydrocyanic
and ferrocyanic acids, the latter of which when united
with the peroxide of iron, forms the perferrocyanate of iron,
commonly called Prussian blue. Caromel also, that peculiar
substance which is disengaged from sugar and various
saccharine substances, when submitted to the action of heat,
is a product, resulting from the decomposition of the sugar.
The empyreumatic, or <i>burnt</i> flavour of certain distilled liquors,
which is corrected by redistillation with charcoal, or
passing the liquor through a filter of charcoal, is owing to
the same cause. The changes, that bodies undergo by partial
roasting, are familiar to every one; as, for instance, the
torrefaction of barley, after germination, in the preparation of
malt, the degree of which determines the colour and taste
of the beer; the roasting of rye and coffee, before they can
be employed to form a beverage; and the torrefaction of the
cocoa, before it can be made into chocolate, the sweet taste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
and brown colour of which are acquired in the process, are all
examples of the effect of heat on bodies. The action of
heat, according to its temperature, produces, therefore, effects
of a particular kind; and, as we regulate the heat in
such cases, we form products of different kinds. Destructive
distillation, however, would again change the character
of these products.  Of this kind, we may consider the effect
of the heat, produced in the combustion of inflammable
substances. In a word, the action of heat may be so graduated,
in the same manner as the tempering of steel, as to
produce only partial changes, which must ensue at certain
temperatures; or, by an increment of heat, in which a total
decomposition takes place, the effect is regulated, by the
force of affinities, exerting their influence under modified
circumstances.  Hence we perceive, by reasoning <i>a priori</i>,
that as substances are altered by the action of heat, so they
produce new compounds, according to the circumstances of
the action, and with or without the agency of foreign bodies.
These facts are so far applicable to the subject under consideration,
as to enable us to explain, or account for the effects
that result on the mixture, or combustion, of bodies, a knowledge
of which is undoubtedly necessary to form a theory of
fire-works in general.</p>

<p class="center"><a name="MATx" id="MATx"></a>OF MATCHES, LEADERS, AND TOUCH PAPER.</p>


<p>We purpose, in the fourth part of our work, to go into the
detail of the manufacture of various kinds of matches,
which belong more particularly to military pyrotechny, adding,
at this time, that fire matches are differently formed,
and are called the quick and slow match. The former is
commonly made of three cotton strands, drawn into lengths,
and put into a kettle, and just covered with vinegar, (usually
white wine vinegar), a quantity of saltpetre and meal powder
being added, and the whole boiled together. Some put only
saltpetre into water, and, after soaking the cotton, place it,
while hot, in a trough with some meal powder, moistened
with some spirits of wine, or brandy, which are thoroughly
worked into the cotton, by rolling it backwards, and forwards
with the hands. When this is done, they are taken out separately,
and, after being drawn through meal powder, dried
upon a line. Another mode is to steep the cotton first in
vinegar, and then rub into it the following composition:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Composition for quick-match.</i></p>

<tr><td class="tdl">As much cotton as will take up all the above, which will be about,&nbsp;</td><td class="tdlv">1</td><td class="tdlv">do.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="p1">To the proportions of one pound and three-quarters of cotton,
one pound of saltpetre, two quarts of spirits of wine,
one pound of meal powder, and three quarts of water, some
recommend the addition of four ounces of isinglass, dissolved
in three pints of water.</p>

<p>Another method is to steep the matches in brandy, and
then rub them well with priming powder.</p>

<p>Slow match is made of hemp, or tow, spun on a wheel
like cord, but very slack, and is composed of three twists,
which are afterwards again covered with tow, so that the
twists do not appear. It is finished by boiling in the lees of
old wine. This, when lighted at the end, burns gradually,
without going out.</p>

<p>There are several modes of preparing slow match. There
is also, a kind of slow match, which is <i>slower</i> in carrying
fire than the preceding quick match. The quick match, for
this purpose, is drawn through the following composition,
which is melted, and the operation is continued until it attains
the size of a small candle; it is then hung up to dry.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Composition for a slow match.</i></p>

<p class="p1">When these matches are used, they are to be <i>lighted</i>, and
then blown out. If well made, they will burn a long time.
They may be used for communicating fire from one work to
another. Another slow match, used for common purposes,
is made by soaking hempen cord in the following ley:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Lixivium for slow match.</i></p>

<tr><td class="tdl">Water,</td><td class="tdr" colspan="3">a sufficient quantity.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="p1">The cords are put into a pot, and boiled for two or three
days, renewing the lixivium from time to time, as it evaporates.
They are then taken out and dried. Good match
makes a hard coal. Its duration depends upon the quality
of the materials; but, generally, four inches will last an hour.</p>

<p>Further remarks on this subject, will be found in the
fourth part of this work, in which the various modern improvements
are given.</p>

<p>The preparation of <i>touch paper</i>, for capping of serpents,
crackers, &amp;c. may be here noticed. The directions of artists
are: To dissolve in spirits of wine, or vinegar, a little saltpetre,
and immerse into the solution, some purple or blue
paper, and dry it for use. There is no advantage gained by
using either spirits of wine, or vinegar: for the simple solution
of the saltpetre in water, will be sufficient. In the former
case, it may dry sooner, but neither of these fluids can
add to the effect of the saltpetre.</p>

<p>In using this paper, care must be taken to prevent the
paste which is made use of, from touching any part, that is
to burn. The method of using it, is by cutting it into slips,
sufficiently long to go once round the mouth of a serpent,
cracker, &amp;c. When they are pasted on, be careful to leave
a little above the mouth of the case not pasted; then prime
with meal powder, and twist the paper to a point.</p>

<p>The mode of threading and joining leaders, and placing
them on different works, we shall here describe. The observations
of a writer in the <cite>Encyclopedia Britannica</cite>, vol.
xv, p. 713, are pointed on this subject, which we will briefly
notice. Joining and placing leaders, is a very essential part
of fire-works; as it is on the leaders that the performance of
all complex works depends. The works being prepared,
and ready to be clothed, the pipes must be cut of a sufficient
length to reach from one case to the other; and then put in
the quick match, which must always be made to go in very
easy. When the match is in, cut it off within about an
inch of the end of the pipe, and let it project as much at the
other end; then fasten the pipe to the mouth of each case,
with a pin, and put the loose ends of the match into the
mouths of the cases, with a little meal powder. This being
done, paste over the mouth of each case, two or three bits of
paper. This method is used for large cases.</p>

<p>The practice adopted for small cases, and for illuminations,
is the following: First, thread a long pipe; then lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
it on the tops of the cases, and cut a bit of the under side
over the mouth of each case, so that the match may appear,
and then pin the pipe to every other case, observing, before
the pipes are put on, to put a little meal powder in the mouth
of each case. If the cases, thus clothed, are port-fires on
illuminated works, cover the mouth of each case, with a single
paper; but if they are choaked cases, situated so, that a
number of sparks from other works, may fall on them before
they are fired, secure them with three or four papers,
which must be pasted on very smooth, that there may be no
creases for the sparks to lodge in, which often set fire to the
works before their time. Avoid, as much as possible,
placing the leaders too near, or one across the other, so as to
touch; as it may happen, that the flash of one will fire the
other. If the works should be so formed that the leaders
must cross, or touch, they must be made very strong, and
well secured at the joints, and at every opening.</p>

<p>When a great length of pipe is required, it must be made
by joining several pipes, in the following manner: Having
put on one length of match, as many pipes as it will hold,
paste paper over every joint; but, if a still greater length is
required, more pipe must be joined, by cutting about an inch
off one side of each pipe near the end, laying the quick-match
together, and tying them fast with a small twine; after which,
cover the joining with pasted paper.</p>

<p><i>Leaders</i>, or pipes of communication, are formed of paper,
which is cut into slips three or four inches broad, so that,
when it is rolled on the mandril or form, it may go three or
four times round. When they are very thick, they are too
strong for the paper which fastens them to the works, and
will sometimes fly off without leading the fire. The forms
for these leaders are made from two to six-sixteenths of an
inch in diameter; but four-sixteenths is the size generally
made use of. The forms are made of smooth brass wire;
and, when used, they are to be rubbed over with grease, or
wet with paste, to prevent their sticking to the paper, which
must be pasted all over. In rolling of pipes, make use of a
rolling board, but press it lightly. Having rolled a pipe, draw
out the form with one hand, holding the pipe as light as possible
with the other, and avoiding any unnecessary pressure.
Leaders are made of different lengths; and, in cutting them,
as is often the case, care must be taken to do it with as little
waste as possible. Leaders for marron batteries must be
made of strong cartridge paper.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Etoupille</i> of the French is the same as the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
match; it being nothing more than a kind of quick-match,
prepared by soaking three threads of cotton in a paste, composed
of the best priming gunpowder and brandy.  It is designed
to communicate fire with promptness, from one part
of a fire-work to another, and, therefore, has the same effect
as the common cotton quick-match. The cotton is usually
soaked, or steeped in a paste of gunpowder and brandy, neither
too thick nor too thin, for the space of two hours, adding
more of the brandy as it evaporates. In the French
preparation, gum arabic is used, in the proportion of one
ounce to a pound of powder. In the English preparation,
isinglass, or fish glue is employed, in the proportion of four
ounces dissolved in three pints of water. Gummy and gelatinous
substances are calculated for no other purpose, than
to make the powder adhere to the cotton, the quantity not
being sufficient to retard the combustion of the match. Pipes
or leaders of communication, are an essential part of fire-works,
and hence great care and attention are required in
preparing them. Cotton, prepared in the manner already described,
is the substance generally made use of. It has the
property of imbibing fluids with facility; and when spirit of
wine, or brandy, or even water, is used, it absorbs, and mechanically
combines with the gunpowder, the impregnation
with which determines the quality of the match. Alcohol,
deprived of as much water as possible, or, in other words,
the most concentrated, appears to have an advantage over
brandy or water. If it be used merely as a vehicle, in order
to suspend the gunpowder, and likewise to carry it, as it
were, into the fibres of the cotton, which appears to be its
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</i>, then it is undoubtedly preferable to either
brandy or water. The former, as it never exceeds fourth
proof, contains always a considerable quantity of water; and,
therefore, as water decomposes gunpowder, by dissolving the
nitre, and separating the sulphur and charcoal, on which it
has no effect, it is obvious, that the gunpowder itself, when
mixed with brandy, is more or less injured. It is true, however,
that the cotton in that case would be more effectually
saturated with the nitre; but it does not follow, that it would
be saturated with the gunpowder; as two of its component
parts, <i>viz.</i> the charcoal and sulphur, would be separated.
We have seen, that <i>touch paper</i> is nothing more than paper,
soaked in a solution of, and consequently impregnated with,
nitre; but, in order to render a match more combustible, and
convey fire with more rapidity, which is required in many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
cases, gunpowder is the only substance, that possesses this
property in any degree.</p>

<p>The cotton, which is used for this purpose, is the same as
that for candle wick, and, with respect to thickness, may be
from one to six threads, according to the pipe, it is intended
for. The pipe must always be large enough for the match,
so that the match may be pushed in easily without breaking
it. After it is doubled into as many strands as required, it
is usually put into a flat bottomed copper, or earthen pan,
and there boiled in a solution of saltpetre. It is then taken
out, and coiled into another pan, and the remaining solution
is poured on. Meal-powder is then put in, and pressed down,
till it is quite wet. It is then wound upon a reel, keeping the
hands moistened with the powder and fluid of the last kettle,
and suffered to remain a short time; when it is taken
down, and meal-powder sifted on both sides of it, till it appears
quite dry. When dry, it is cut, and secured in skins.</p>

<p>There is one advantage in this process, that the cotton in
the first place is saturated with nitre; and, in the second
place, while still wet, is combined mechanically with the
meal-powder. The match I apprehend, is in all respects equal
to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">etoupille</i> of the French.</p>

<p>The priming paste, as it is called, consisting of meal-powder
and brandy, may be preserved in close vessels for a
length of time; and, when used, may be brought to a proper
degree of consistency, to be worked, by the addition of more
brandy.</p>

<p>The preparation of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">etoupille</i>, or match for communicating
fire, will be given at large, when we treat of military fire-matches.
It will be sufficient to remark, that its preparation,
according to Bigot, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité d'Artifice de Guerre</cite>, p. 74), consists
in macerating the cotton in vinegar, then pressing it, and
steeping it in brandy, and afterwards working it in a paste,
composed of meal-powder, gum arabic, camphor, and brandy,
and then rolling it on a table with meal-powder.</p>

<p>In preparing all kinds of matches, we may increase or lessen
their effect by increasing or diminishing the quantity of
gunpowder. By combining powder and sulphur with one or
more parts of melted wax and rosin, in the manner before
mentioned, and immersing the cotton into it, a match will
be formed, which, for some purposes, is considered preferable
to the ordinary kind.</p>

<p>The following proportions are given for preparing 100,000
<i>priming fusées</i>, or matches:</p>

<p class="center">OF THE FURNITURE, OR DECORATIONS FOR
FIRE-WORKS.</p>


<p>By the term <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garniture</i>, used by the French, we understand
the furniture, equipage, embellishments, or decorations for
sundry fire-works, as rockets, bombs, batteries, fire-pots, &amp;c.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. I. Of Serpents.</i></p>

<p>The directions, given for the formation of serpents, are the
same in Morel and Bigot. Paper is rolled lengthwise on a
mandril, or form, which is a quarter of an inch in diameter,
of three thicknesses, according as it is stout, and the last turn
of the paper is pasted. They are made tight and strong, and
strangled first at one end. They are then put upright in a
square or round box, called a <i>bushel</i>, for the purpose of
charging them. For this end we must have a small mallet,
and a rammer of brass, of a smaller diameter than the form.
The composition is put in and rammed, proportioning the
number and force of the blows to the size of the case.
The <i>petard</i> is formed, with extremely fine powder, then rammed,
and the case choaked. To prime them, we open the
ends with a piercer, and by means of a spatula introduce a
portion of priming paste, or priming powder, in order that
the fire may communicate.</p>

<p>We may here remark, that large cases for serpents, as well
as wheel cases, are driven solid. There is usually a mould,
in which is a nipple, with a point at top, that serves, when
the case is filling, to stop the neck, and prevent the composition
from falling out. The air, in that event, would get into
the case, and cause it to burst. These sorts of moulds
are made of any length or diameter, as the cases are required;
but the diameter of the form must be equal to half the
caliber, and the rammers solid.</p>

<p><i>Lardons</i> are of much the same nature as serpents, but are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
made stronger. They are charged in the same manner. To
prime them, they are first pierced about five or six lines (or
half an inch,) in depth, which presents a greater surface to
the fire, and produces, when inflamed, more scintillations
than serpents.</p>

<p class="p1">The serpents or snakes for pots of aigrettes, small mortars,
skyrockets, &amp;c. are made from two and a half inches, to seven
inches long. Their formers are from three-sixteenths to
five-eighths of an inch in diameter; but the diameter of the
cases must always be equal to two diameters of the former.
They are rolled and choaked like other cases, and filled with
composition, five-eighths of an inch to one and a half inches
high, according to the size of the mortars or rockets, they
are designed for. The remainder of the cases are charged
or <i>bounced</i> with grained powder, and their ends pinched and
tied close. Before they are used, their mouths must be
primed with wet meal powder or priming paste as before-mentioned.</p>

<p>Serpents, or snakes, in fire-works, are so called from the
particular appearance, and the effect which ensues, namely, a
<i>hissing</i> and <i>spitting</i>. This peculiar character is given by
the charcoal; for, while one part is actually consumed, in immediate
contact with the substances that enter into the composition;
another part is thrown out with violence in the state
of ignition, in the form of sparks, and receives, for the support
of its combustion, the oxygen of the air, in consequence of
which carbonic acid is produced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. II. Of Crackers.</i></p>

<p>Crackers are made in the following manner; cut some cartridge
paper into pieces, three and a half inches broad, and one
foot long. One edge of each paper fold down lengthwise,
about three-quarters of an inch broad. Then fold the double
edge down one quarter of an inch, and turn the single edge
back half over the double fold. Open it, and lay all along the
channel, which is formed by the folding of the paper, some
meal powder. It must now be folded over and over till all
the paper is doubled up, rubbing it at every turn. It is now
to be bent backwards and forwards, two and a half inches or
more, as often as the paper will allow. These folds are to be
held flat and close; and, with a small pinching cord, give one
turn round the middle of the cracker, and pinch it close.
Bind, as usual, with pack thread, in the place where it was
pinched. Prime one end of it, and cap it with touch paper.
When these crackers are fired, they will give a report at
every turn of the paper. If there are to be a great number
of <i>bounces</i>, the paper must be cut longer, or be joined after
they are made. If, however, they are made very long before
they are pinched, there must be a piece of wood, having a
groove sufficiently deep to let in half the cracker, which will
hold it straight, while it is pinching.</p>

<p>The report, produced by crackers, is on the same principle
as the report of a gun. The reports, which succeed each
other, in crackers, formed in this manner, depends, as we
remarked, on the turn of the paper, each turn producing
that effect. Every part of the cracker, by this division, represents
in fact a gun; and hence, as the combustion of one
part necessarily succeeds that of another, we have, according
to the number of turns, successive explosions.</p>

<p>Crackers, formed in this way, may furnish a variety in exhibitions.
They may be either hung on a board, or set off on
the ground. As to the report itself, it may be increased or
diminished by enlarging or diminishing the size of each
cracker, or division.</p>

<p>Crackers, as they are usually called, are nothing more than
small cases charged with gunpowder. The Chinese squibs
are crackers of this description. Some are four ounce cases;
but the squibs, so named, hold about half a thimble full of
powder. A piece of twisted match paper is inserted in the
mouth of each of them. They are made of five or six turns
of paper, and the last one is pasted and formed of red paper.
The interior diameter is about a quarter of an inch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. III. Of Single Reports.</i></p>

<p>Cases for reports are generally rolled on one or two ounce
formers, and seldom made larger, except on particular occasions.
They are from two to four inches in length, and are
formed of thick paper. Having rolled a case, pinch one end,
quite close, and drive it down. Then fill the case with grain
powder, leaving sufficient room to pinch at the top. Before
it is pinched, a piece of paper is to be put on the powder at
the top. Reports are fired by a vent bored in the middle,
or at one end. Among the portable Chinese fire-works, reports
form usually a large number. They are closed with
clay, which is perforated to admit the match and priming.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="STAx" id="STAx"></a><i>Sec. IV. Of Serpent Stars.</i></p>

<p>There are a variety of compositions, used to produce the
appearance of stars. Thus, there are stars of different colours,
which also produce tails of sparks, scintillations, more or less
vivid, &amp;c. and are calculated for particular exhibitions.
The serpent stars, however, have a different object, namely,
to imitate a star at first, and afterwards a serpent.</p>

<p>The cases for serpent stars are choaked half an inch lower
than the common kind; and, after filling the hole with meal
powder, the following composition is put in. It is finished,
but without the operation of choaking, by adapting a piece
of quickmatch, and adding more priming powder.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Composition for serpent stars.</i></p>

<p class="p1">Serpent stars are of two kinds. The one is intended as the
furniture for rockets, &amp;c. and the other, when moulded, to be
employed in the Roman candles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>When required to be moulded, or made into cakes, the
composition is mixed with gum and brandy, into a paste,
which is spread upon a table, having previously covered the
table with meal powder. Small cubical or other shaped pieces
are cut out, sprinkled with meal powder, and dried in the
shade. The meal powder serves as a priming, so that they
may all take fire at the same time. The composition may
be formed into balls.</p>

<p>Serpent stars, being designed to produce a combined effect,
it appears, that, while charcoal, (and, in some instances, the
sulphur, according to the formula, but more especially the
charcoal), imparts the serpentlike appearance, the antimony,
in its turn, diversifies the flame by giving to it an asteroid
character. The antimony, used in these compositions, is
not the regulus, but the crude, or common sulphuret. Metallic
antimony, however, would produce the effect in a greater
degree: but as sulphur enters into their composition, and
also into the crude antimony, there would be but little, if any,
advantage, gained in the use of the regulus.</p>

<p>Besides the ordinary products of the combustion of gunpowder,
or similar products, by employing nitre, charcoal,
and sulphur, the antimony, by its combustion, would be
changed into an oxide, or, if the combustion is sufficiently
rapid, and the quantity of oxygen absorbed proportionate
thereto, it would form the antimonic acid. That it is oxidized,
however, and that during its oxidizement, the appearance
we have mentioned takes place, there can be no doubt.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. V. Of Whirling Serpents.</i></p>

<p>Serpents, prepared in the following manner, have a peculiar
effect, by which they are characterized. They form in
the air a kind of whirling sun; and, as they revolve by reason
of their fire issuing out at the opposite sides of their extremities,
they resemble the sun turning on its axis.</p>

<p>Barker's hydraulic machine, described in Gregory's Mechanics,
which is put in motion by two opposite currents of
water, acting from the two extremities of an oblong box, supported
by a perpendicular hollow shaft, through which the
water first passes, acts upon the same principle as this revolving
sun. The ascension of rockets is also to be accounted
for in the same way. See <a href="#GENx"><i>General Theory of Fire-works</i>.</a></p>

<p>The whirling serpents are charged entirely with composition.
No grain powder is used. A small paper stopper is
rammed on the top of the composition. Near the two chokes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
but in opposite sides, the cases are pierced with small holes,
which are made to communicate with each other, and with
the composition, by means of a short leader or match.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VI. Of Chinese Flyers.</i></p>

<p>Somewhat similar to whirling serpents are the Chinese
flyers. Cases for flyers may be made of different sizes, from
one to eight ounces. They are formed of thick paper, and
are eight interior diameters long. They are rolled in the
same manner as tourbillons, with a straight pasted edge, and
pinched close at one end.</p>

<p>The case, being put in a mould, whose cylinder, or foot, must
be flat at top, without a nipple, is to be filled within half a diameter
of the middle. Then ram in half a diameter of clay, and,
on that, as much composition as before; and again put in half
a diameter of clay. Pinch the case then close, and drive it
down flat, and afterwards bore a hole exactly through the
centre of the clay in the middle. In opposite sides, at both
ends, make a vent, and, in that side, intended to be fired first,
a small hole to the composition, near the clay in the middle,
from which carry a quickmatch, covered with a single paper,
to the vent at the other end. Then, when the charge is burnt
on one side, it will, by means of the quickmatch, communicate
to the charge on the other, which may be of a different
sort.</p>

<p>The flyers being thus prepared, put an iron pin, that must
be fixed in the work, in which they are to be fired, and on
which they are to run, through the hole in the middle. On
the end of this pin, must be a nut to secure it. If they are
required to turn back again, after they are burnt, make both
the vents at the ends in the same side, which will alter its
course the contrary way.</p>

<p>These flyers are intended to revolve on an axis, and to discharge
at different periods. For this purpose, a communication
is made from one vent to the other. It is evident,
that the clay, which occupies the middle of the case, is intended
to prevent any communication of fire, in the tube,
from one end to the other, as this is effected on the outside.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VII. Of Simple Stars.</i></p>

<p>The stars, which are not made upon the former, or roller,
serve to furnish bombs and rockets. They are made in the
following manner: The composition being well mixed, and
passed through a fine sieve, is made into a paste, with gum arabic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
and brandy. The proportion of the gum to the composition,
is as one to sixteen. The composition is spread
equally on a table, about the thickness of a finger, and cut
into small square pieces. They are then covered with meal-powder,
which will serve for priming, and are dried in the
shade.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Composition for Simple Stars.</i></p>

</table>

<p class="p1">This is the general composition, however, for stars.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VIII. Of Rolled Stars.</i></p>

<p>It will be sufficient to remark, that rolled stars are formed
of the same composition as the simple stars. The composition
is mixed with gum and brandy, formed into a paste,
spread upon a table, and cut, by a circular instrument, into
pieces of the size of the Roman candle, of which we shall
speak hereafter. They are primed with the best pistol powder,
and dried in the shade. See <a href="#ROMx"><i>Roman Candle</i>.</a></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. IX. Of Cracking Stars.</i></p>

<p>Cracking stars are nothing more than small marrons.
They are primed, and covered afterwards with <i>star-paste</i>, in
the same manner as meteors. They are employed as furniture
for serpents and stars. They are rolled in meal-powder, before
they are used. They are the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">étoiles à pet</i> of the French.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. X. Of Sundry Compositions for Stars designed for Various
Purposes.</i></p>

<p>We purpose, in this section, to present a connected view
of the different star-compositions, by merely introducing the
formulæ for their preparation. Their application will claim

</table>

<p class="p1">We will have occasion hereafter, to notice the different
modes of fixing, and arranging stars; the formation of strung
stars, rolled and drove stars, &amp;c. Great care must be taken
in making stars, that the several ingredients are reduced to
a fine powder, and the composition is well worked and mixed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
The instructions for rolling of stars, are the following: Before
we begin to roll, take a pound of the composition, and
wet it with the following liquid, sufficient to make it stick
together, and roll easy, <i>viz</i>: Spirit of wine one quart, in
which dissolve <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> of an ounce of isinglass. If a great
quantity of composition be wetted at once, the spirit will
evaporate, and leave it dry, before all the stars are rolled.
Having rolled one portion, shake the stars in meal-powder,
and set them to dry, which will require three or four days;
but, if wanted for immediate use, they may be dried in an
earthen pan, over a slow heat, or in an oven. It is very
difficult to make the stars all of an equal size, when the
composition is taken up promiscuously with the fingers; but,
by the following method, they may be made very exact:
When the mixture is moistened properly, roll it on a flat
smooth stone, and cut it into square pieces, making each square
large enough for the stars required. There is another method
used by some, which consists in rolling the composition
in long pieces, and then cutting off the stars; so that each
star will be of a cylindrical form. This method, however,
is not so good as the former; for, in order to make the composition
roll in this manner, it must be made very wet,
which makes the stars heavy, as well as weakens their effect.
All stars must be kept as much from the air as possible;
otherwise they will lose their properties.</p>

<p>What are called, in pyrotechny, the flaming stars, with
brilliant wheels, the moon and seven stars, the transparent
stars with illuminated rays, the transparent table star, the
projected star, and the illuminated star wheel, are all particular
exhibitions, which are produced by disposing the works
in a certain form and order. They have, therefore, no relation
to those preparations, or compositions, which produce
stars. They will be considered, however, in their respective
places, when we treat of the disposition and arrangement of
fire-works.</p>

<p>As a general theory of stars, we may remark, that while
combustion ensues, as in other fire-works, in the manner explained
in our chapter on that subject, some substances are
always employed, which have, for their object, two effects
in particular; <i>viz.</i> that of modifying the appearance of the
flame, by producing certain colours, and increasing or diminishing
the degree of combustion, and that of throwing out,
at the same time, scintillations or sparks. The latter effect,
however, is not so great in stars, as in some other preparations,
which are designed especially for the purpose. That
certain substances have a particular effect, which uniformly
ensues, under the same circumstances, is a fact obvious to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
all. Hence, we see in all the numerous formulæ for stars, for
those that produce a red, a blue, a yellow, or any other flame,
and those which form tails, sparks, &amp;c. being modified according
to circumstances, that the <i>effect</i> is owing to the presence
of one, and sometimes to the action of two, three, and more
substances, co-operating together. That combustion may be
greater or less; that it may be accelerated, retarded, and
otherwise modified; that the flame of inflammable bodies
may be varied, as to colour, by the presence of foreign substances;
that the action of one substance upon another, in
certain elevated temperatures, may produce results which
would not take place at a reduced temperature; that, for the
support of combustion, the oxygen of the nitre, or the oxygen
gas of the atmosphere, may, singly, or jointly, produce
that effect, as in instances of rapid combustion, and in the
combustion of bodies actually thrown out in the state of ignition;&mdash;these
are so many considerations, all necessary to be
attended to, in establishing a theory of stars, as well as of
fire-works in general.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XI. Of the Fire-rain, (filamentous.)</i></p>

<p>Fire-rains are generally two inches long, and formed on
a small copper, iron, or wooden roller, two and a half lines
in diameter. Two turns of the paper are considered sufficient
for them. They are twisted at their extremities, and
struck afterwards on a table, to flatten and close them in the
same manner as common cases. Using a small funnel,
they are charged with the following composition, in the
same manner as serpents. Grained powder, however, is not
employed. When charged, they are primed with paste,
having also, a piece of cotton-match attached to them.</p>

<p>The second kind of rain-fire, called sparks, is made in the

liquid paste with brandy; and eight ounces of flax are immersed
in it, and kept there for some time. The flax is
then rolled into small balls, about the size of peas. They
are then rolled in dry meal-powder, and hung up in the
open air, in the shade to dry.</p>

<p>We purpose to enumerate, in the following section, all the
compositions which have been used for forming gold, as
well as silver rain. The recipe here given, it may be proper
to remark, appears to have been preferred to all others;
as some French authors, and particularly Morel, have given
it a distinct place.</p>

</table>

<p class="p1">These substances are mixed, treated, cut, and primed in the
same way as simple stars. They must be cut all of the same
size. In the furnishing of rockets and bombs, the effect
they produce, is very striking. With respect to the scintillated
rain-fire, or that which appears in sparks, the effect
is owing to the flax, which, being soaked in a mixture of
meal-powder, saltpetre, camphor, and brandy, in the same
manner as before stated, produces, when inflamed, a succession
of fire, under the form we have mentioned. The camphor
seems to add to the brilliancy of the flame. There is
no doubt but a part, at least, if not the whole, is burnt, in
consequence of the oxygen of the air, the inflammation of
the gunpowder bringing it to the state of ignition. The
powder itself produces at first the combustion. The flax is,
therefore, consumed, which seems to be the last of the process,
filaments, at the same time, being produced, and the
combustion accelerated by the nitre.</p>

<p>The fire-rain owes its effect to the charcoal, which is
thrown out in the state of ignition. In the gold fire, the effect
is owing to the presence of lampblack, soot, and nitre. There
are several methods of producing both gold and silver rains,
which we will notice in the following section.</p>

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XV. Of Rain-Falls, and Stars, double and single.</i></p>

<p>The cases which contain the gold and silver rain compo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>sition,
are pinched close at one end. If they are rolled dry,
four or five rounds of paper will be sufficient; but, if they
are pasted, three rounds will be strong enough.  The thin
sort of cartridge paper is best for those small cases, which,
in rolling, must not have the inside edge turned down, as in
other cases, for a double edge would be too thick for so
small a caliber. The moulds for rain falls should be made of
brass, and turned very smooth in the inside; or the cases,
being very thin, would tear in coming out. The charge
must be driven in light, and the better the case fits the mould,
the more driving it will bear. These moulds have no nipple,
but are made flat. It is necessary to have a funnel made of
thin tin, to fit on the top of the case, by the help of which,
they may be filled very fast. For single rain-falls for four
ounce rockets, let the diameter of the former or roller be
two-sixteenths of an inch, and the length of the case two inches;
for eight-ounce rockets, four-sixteenths, and two diameters
of the rocket long; for two-pound rockets, five-sixteenths,
and three and a half inches long; for four-pound
rockets, six-sixteenths, and four and a half inches long; and
for six pounders, seven-sixteenths, in diameter, and five
inches long.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of double rain-falls described: some
appear first like a star, and then as rain; and some appear
first as rain, and then like a star. These different appearances
may be produced in the following manner: When
stars are to be formed first, the cases must be filled within
half an inch of the top, with rain composition, and the remainder
with star composition; but when it is intended that
the rain should be first, we must drive the case half an inch
with star composition, and the rest with rain. By this method,
they may make many changes of fire; for in large
rockets, they may be made to burn first as stars, then as
rain, and again as stars; or, they may first show rain, then
stars, and finish with a report. When they are thus managed,
cut open the first rammed end, after they are filled and
<i>bounced</i>, at which place they are to be primed. The star
composition for this purpose, must be a little stronger than
that for rolled stars.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XVI. Of Substances which show in Sparks.</i></p>

<p>There are many substances, which show in sparks, when
rammed in choaked cases. The set colours are produced by
regular charges. Other charges are called compound and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
brilliant. Set colours, produced by sparks, are divided into
four sorts, which are denominated, the white, black, gray,
and red. The charges, to produce these several effects, are
composed of various ingredients. Thus, meal-powder and
charcoal compose the black charges; saltpetre, sulphur, and
charcoal, the white; meal powder, saltpetre, sulphur, and
charcoal, the gray; and saltpetre, charcoal, and sawdust, the
red.</p>

<p>With respect to compound and brilliant charges, the former
is composed of many ingredients; such as meal-powder,
saltpetre, sulphur, charcoal, sawdust, sea-coal, antimony,
glass-dust, brass-dust, steel dust, cast-iron, tanner's dust, &amp;c.
or any thing that will yield sparks; all which must be managed
with discretion, or judgment. Brilliant charges, on the
contrary, are composed of meal-powder, saltpetre, sulphur,
and steel-filings, or of meal-powder and steel-filings only, and
sometimes of Chinese fire.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XVII. Of Italian Roses, or Fixed Stars.</i></p>

<p>We prepare cases for these works, in the same manner as
described in the article respecting fixed stars. Half a spoonful
of clay is put into them, which is rammed tightly, with
twelve blows of a mallet of a moderate size. The height of
the clay is then marked upon the case, which is then charged
with four spoonfuls of the composition, ramming each spoonful
with twelve blows of the mallet. These four charges
should occupy about two fingers in height. After this we
add another spoonful of earth; and divide, on the outside of
the case, from the point we marked, five equal parts. We
then apply the quick-match and paste. One end of the match
is of a sufficient length, in order that it may turn round, and
come out above the other choke. We afterwards roll the
case in white paper, which must go twice round, and extend
beyond each extremity about one and a half inches. This is
called the covering. The lower end is twisted. The other
end, the side of which is twisted, resembles a goblet, and
serves to inflame the rose.</p>

<p>The composition of the rose is given in the table for those
of revolving and fixed pieces. Their effect is, that they will
produce as many <i>streams</i> of flames as there are holes, and
consequently form the roses or stars. The composition is six
parts of powder, eight saltpetre, five sulphur, and half a
part of antimony; or two powder, four saltpetre, and one sulphur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XVIII. Of Lances of Illumination, white, blue, and yellow.</i></p>

<p>We have already given the caliber, and the manner of
forming the lances. They are charged by using the funnel
and rammer, in the same manner as serpents, but without any
grain-powder. They are filled within two-twelfths of their
end, and primed with the paste without the match. The
blue and yellow lances are loaded in the same manner. The
yellow are made one-third of an inch in diameter, and one
inch and a third in length; so as not to be of a longer duration
in burning than the others.</p>

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXI. Of Lances for Petards.</i></p>

<p>Lances for petards are a kind of port-fire, used in war,
but not very often. As they will be noticed hereafter, it
may be sufficient to remark, that they are formed of cartridge
paper, and the case is strangled in the usual manner;
that a small portion of bran is put in, and then about as
much good priming pistol powder in grains; that the case is
then strangled, or choaked, about two-thirds of its length,
the remaining one-third serving for a handle; and, in using
it, that the twisted end is cut off, so that the fire may communicate
to the petard.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="LANx" id="LANx"></a><i>Sec. XXII. Of Lances of Service.</i></p>

<p>These lances serve for setting fire to works, &amp;c. They are
commonly made fifteen inches long, upon a former or roller,
one-fourth of an inch in diameter. Four turns of the paper
are sufficient for the case. They are charged in the same way
as the petard lances, and also in the manner described for
port-fires. They are primed with the match and paste.</p>

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXIII. Of Marrons.</i></p>

<p>Marrons are made in several ways. We shall first describe
those in cases. Formers for marrons are from three-fourths
of an inch, to one and a half in diameter. The paper for
the cases must be cut twice the diameter of the former; broad,
and sufficiently long to make three revolutions. When a
case is rolled, paste down the edge, and tie one end close;
and to remove the wrinkles, and make it flat at bottom, put
in the former and drive it down. The case is then to be
charged with granulated powder, one diameter and a quarter
high, and the rest of the case, folded down tight on the
powder.</p>

<p>The marrons being thus made, wax some strong pack-thread
with shoemaker's wax, and wind it up in a ball. Then
unwind two or three yards of it, and that part, which is near
the ball, make fast to a hook. Now take a marron, and
stand as far from the hook as the pack-thread will reach, and
wind it lengthwise round it, as close as possible, till it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
hold no more in that direction; then turn it, and wind the
pack-thread on the short way; then lengthwise again, and
continue this winding until the paper is all covered. Make
fast the end of the pack-thread, and beat down both ends of
the marron to bring it in shape.</p>

<p>The method of firing marrons is by making a hole at one
end with an awl, and putting in a piece of quickmatch. Then
take a piece of strong paper, in which wrap the marron with
two leaders, put down to the vent, and tie the paper tight
round with small twine. These leaders are bent on each side,
and their loose ends tied to other marrons, and nailed, in the
middle, to the rail of the stand.</p>

<p>Marron batteries are made of several stands, with a number
of cross rails for the marrons, which are regulated by
leaders, by cutting them of different lengths, and nailing them
tight or loose. This arrangement, however, is only intended
for a certain purpose. For as marrons, if well managed,
will keep time to a march or a piece of music; so, by regulating
them in that way, that is to say, by cutting the leaders
of different lengths and nailing them tight or loose, we may
adjust the time of their explosion by the time of the music.
In forming batteries with marrons, the large and small kinds
must be used, and the nails for the leaders, or pipes of communication
must have flat heads. The <i>marrons for service</i> are
a different kind; they resemble the incendiary bombs. See
<a href="#MILx">Fourth Part of the work.</a></p>

<p>The other kind of marron for fire-works, as described by
Morel, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité Practique des Feux D'Artifice</cite> p. 37,) and
Bigot, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité d'Artifice de Guerre</cite> p. 141,) are of a cubical
form and of a suitable size for the <i>pot</i>, in which it is to
enter, or of any dimensions, if it be fired alone, or without
being employed as a decoration. These cubes are filled with
grain powder, and are covered with two layers of pack-thread,
which is bound very tightly, and over this, a coat of
pitch or tar. They are pierced to the powder, and a match
is adapted in the usual manner. Port-fire has been used,
but is considered to possess no advantages.</p>

<p>The cubical marrons are formed in the following manner:
Divide a piece of strong pasteboard in such a manner, as
that each division will form one of the sides of the cube, as
represented in the following figure.</p>

with paper pasted over them. The pack-thread must be well
waxed with shoemakers' wax, before it is wound on it.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="SHMx" id="SHMx"></a><i>Sec. XXIV. Of Shining Marrons.</i></p>

<p>Shining marrons are cubes of an inch at least on each surface,
and prepared in the same manner as the preceding.
The excess of the match, which is cut off in the former
marron, is sufficient for these smaller marrons. Cotton is
macerated, or soaked in a paste of the star composition, in
the usual manner, viz: by mixing the composition with brandy,
and a small portion of gum, or a solution of isinglass.
The marron is then covered, about a finger in thickness,
with this cotton; or more may be used, according to circumstances.
It is afterwards rolled in meal powder, which serves
for priming, and then dried in the shade.</p>

<p>Shining marrons are used in furnishing bombs, fire-pots,
and rockets. They produce a brilliant effect; a vivid white
light, which finishes with a report.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXV. Of Saucissons.</i></p>

<p>Saucissons differ from marrons only in form. They are
intended, like them, for simple detonations. They are generally
fired out of large mortars without chambers, the same
as those for aigrettes, only somewhat stronger.</p>

<p>Saucissons are made of one or two-ounce cases, five or six
inches long, and choaked in the same manner as serpents.
Half the number which the mortar contains must be driven
one and a half diameters with composition, and the other
half, two diameters; so that, when fired, they may give two
vollies of reports. But, if the mortars are very strong, and
will bear a sufficient charge to throw the saucissons very
high, there may be three vollies of reports, by dividing the
number of cases into three parts, and making a difference in
the height of the charge. After they are filled, pinch and
tie them at the top of the charge, almost close; only leaving
a small vent to communicate the fire to the upper part of the
case, which must be filled with grain powder very near the
top. The end then is to be pinched close and tied, and the
case, bound very tightly with waxed pack-thread, from the
choak, at the top of the composition, to the end of the case.
This will strengthen the case, and cause the report to be very
loud. Saucissons should be rolled a little thicker of paper
than the common proportion. When they are to be put in
the mortar, they must be primed in their <i>mouths</i>, and fired
by a case of brilliant fire, fixed in their centre. The charge
for these mortars should be <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub></span>th or <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>th more than for
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pots d'aigrettes</i> of the same diameter.</p>

<p>For flying saucissons, the French make use of cases of
three-quarters of an inch in exterior diameter. They are
charged, to the height of half an inch, with the composition
for mosaic tourbillons, which see. They are then choaked
and bound at this place, and four fingers of grain powder
are put into each, which is then covered with a stopper of
paper. They are then again choaked and bound, and the excess
of the case is cut off. They are primed with a piece of
match, using the priming paste at the same time. When the
saucissons are required to make a louder report, the part of
the case, in which the powder is, should be wrapped round
with pack-thread, much in the same manner as already described,
and then covered with glue or pitch. These saucissons
are usually put in the pots of the <i>mosaics</i>, some
times in the place of them, and are arranged for exhibition
on the same frame. We may, if we wish to vary the effect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
put a saucisson in one pot, and a mosaic in another. When
thrown in the air, their effect is to occasion a report. They
first, however, form a tail of fire, and finish with an explosion.
Bigot gives the difference between their internal and
external diameters at four lines, or one-third of an inch.</p>

<p>Saucissons may either be used in the manner we have
mentioned or thrown by hand. According to their size,
and the strength of the case, so will be the report. They resemble
a thick and short sausage, hence their name.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="FPUx" id="FPUx"></a><i>Sec. XXVI. Of Fire-Pumps.</i></p>

<p>Fire-pumps are intended for a particular use, which we
will describe hereafter. The composition is the following:</p>

</table>

<p class="p1">Cases for fire-pumps are made like those for tourbillons,
except that they are pasted, instead of being rolled dry. In
charging them, first put in a little meal powder, and then a
star; then a ladleful or two of the above composition, which
ram tightly; then a little meal powder, on that a star, and
then composition again, and so on until the case is filled.
Stars for fire-pumps should not be round; but must be made
either square, or flat and circular, with a hole through the
middle. The quantity of powder for throwing the stars
must increase as we come near the top of the case; for, if
much powder be put at the bottom, it will burst the case.
The stars must differ in size in this manner: Let the star,
which is first put in, be about one-fourth less than the caliber
of the case; but let the next star be a little larger, and the
third star a little larger than the second, and so on for the
rest. Let them increase in diameter till within two of the
top of the case, which two must fit in tight. As the loading
of fire-pumps requires some skill, it will be necessary to
make two or three trials before depending on their performance.</p>

<p>When a number of pumps are filled, care must be taken
not to put in each an equal quantity of charge between the
stars; so that, when they are fired, they may not throw up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
too many stars together. Cases for fire-pumps should be
made very strong, and rolled on four or eight-ounce formers,
each ten or twelve inches long. For the composition and
preparation of stars, see <a href="#STAx"><i>stars</i>.</a></p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="ARVx" id="ARVx"></a><i>Sec. XXVII. Of the Volcano of Lemery.</i></p>

<p>The artificial earthquake, or volcano of Lemery, is formed
by mixing into a paste with water, about equal parts of
sulphur and steel or iron filings, and burying the mixture in
the earth. The composition in a short time, will grow hot,
and burst out; the earth will break, and open in several
places.</p>

<p>Baumé mixed 100 pounds of iron filings and the same
quantity of sulphur together, with water, and rammed the
mixture into an iron pot. After ten hours, the mass swelled
up and grew warm, aqueous vapours arose, and the mass
burst. Ten hours afterwards, the heat, vapours, &amp;c. greatly
increased, and a flame issued forth, lasting only from 2 to 3
minutes. Finally, the mass became red-hot, and the burning
and heat continued 40 hours longer; but without flame.</p>

<p>We may merely remark, that this effect is produced by the
chemical union, which takes place between the sulphur and
iron, forming a sulphuret of iron, analogous in composition
to the native martial pyrites. The water is at the same
time, decomposed, during which the mixture swells, becomes
hot, and throws up the earth, producing at the same time a
large quantity of sulphuretted hydrogen gas. This gas is
formed by the combination of a part of the sulphur with the
hydrogen of the water; whilst the oxygen, the other element
of the water, goes to oxidize the metal and to acidify the remaining
sulphur. Hence sulphate of iron, or green vitriol
is produced. The experiment may be made in a common
basin.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact, that spontaneous combustion,
which takes place without the application of an ignited body,
ensues in a variety of instances; and new facts daily occur,
which show, that cases of this kind are more numerous than
we had reason to suspect. Besides the old and well known
effect of quicklime, pyrites, pyritous schist, &amp;c. in producing
spontaneous combustion, it is found, that ashes and oil,
oil and cotton, and a number of substances have set fire to
cotton mills, and other works.</p>

<p>It is known, that, in the slaking of quicklime, a considerable
degree of heat is produced. This is owing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
solidification of the water, or its union with the lime in the
form of a hydrate, and the consequent change, which the
caloric undergoes from a latent to an uncombined state.
Hence inflammable substances, in contact with lime, under
these circumstances, are necessarily set on fire.</p>

<p>Spontaneous combustion arises simply from a play of
chemical affinities. The following general observations on
this subject are given by Nicholson, (<cite>Chemical Dictionary</cite>);
and an enumeration of the effects may lead to cautions of
importance for preventing serious accidents: "If quicklime,
in any quantity, be laid in contact with any combustible, as
wood, and be wetted by accident, or to make it into mortar,
a sufficient quantity of heat may be extricated to set fire
to the wood. Animal or vegetable substances, laid together
damp in large heaps, undergo a fermentation, which often
excites combustion, as in the case of hay-ricks. Woollen
cloth, not freed from the oil used in dressing it, and laid up
damp in large heaps, has been known to take fire; and so has
painted canvass. Flowers and herbs boiled in oil, as is done
by druggists, and then laid in heaps, sometimes do the same.
The mixture of linseed oil and lampblack, or of linseed oil
and black wad, is very liable to inflame. Torrefied vegetables,
as malt, coffee, or bran, put while hot, into coarse bags,
are apt to take fire. The spontaneous combustion of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'phosporous'">phosphorus</ins>,
and various pyrophori, is well known. It is suspected
to be owing to the presence of one or other of these, that
charcoal sometimes takes fire without any apparent cause;
and the charcoal of peat is said to be particularly liable to
this. Hyperoxygenated muriate of potassa, mixed with sulphur,
or with sulphur and charcoal, is apt to detonate spontaneously.</p>

<p>"Many cases of spontaneous combustion taking place in
the human body too are on record: and it has been observed,
that all the persons, who thus suffered, were much addicted
to the use of spirituous liquors."</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXVIII. Of the blue and green Match, for Cyphers
Devices, and Decorations.</i></p>

<p>We had occasion to mention, that blue and green flame
may be produced by employing sundry substances, which
have the property of changing the colour of flame. This is
effected in the present instance.</p>

<p>For the preparation of the match, we melt one pound of
roll brimstone in a glazed earthen vessel, over a slow fire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
and add one ounce of finely pulverized verdigris, and half
an ounce of antimony. The cotton for the match, may be of
any length and thickness, as we judge proper; and is to be
immersed, and well soaked, in the wetted sulphur, having
previously put in the verdigris, and antimony. Sulphur alone
will form a blue light.</p>

<p>The matches are afterwards tied to a rod of iron, which
is bent according to the design we purpose to form, and to
which they are fastened with a very fine iron wire, called
the <i>carcase</i>. They are covered with priming paste, and a
quick match is tied along the whole length. They are then
covered with bands of gray paper, and a piece of port-fire
is fixed on the end, to communicate fire.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXIX. Of the Purple or Violet Match.</i></p>

<p>The design is made, and the match is attached, in the
same manner as described in the last section; but without
bending it. The preparation is as follows: Make a decoction
of <i>jujubes</i>, which have been <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'pealed'">peeled</ins>, and stoned, and thicken
it by adding as much of the flour of sulphur, as will bring it
to a proper consistence. The cotton is then covered with
this mixture, in the manner before stated; its thickness to be
determined, according to the time required for it to burn.
While hot, the match is primed by rolling it in meal powder.
It is then suffered to dry. The design, it is to be observed,
ought to be supported at the distance of four or five
inches from the rods which hold it, by small cross pieces of
iron, to prevent it taking fire; a circumstance necessary to be
guarded against.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXX. Of Meteors.</i></p>

<p>Artificial fire-works, to resemble meteors in the atmosphere,
have, if properly prepared and exhibited, a brilliant
appearance. The composition must be projected to a great
height, which is either done by rockets, or from mortars.
Meteors are made in the same manner as shining marrons,
which we have already described, except, however, that they
are of a very large size and usually weigh ten pounds. The
larger they are made the better, and the more grand is their
effect. See <a href="#SHMx"><i>Shining Marrons</i>.</a></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a><a href="#TOC_PART_3">CHAPTER VII.</a></h3>

<p class="center"><a name="ROCx" id="ROCx"></a>OF ROCKETS AND THEIR APPENDAGES.</p>


<p>A rocket is a flying fusée, (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fusées Volantes</i> of the French),
formed with paper, of a cylindrical shape, and filled with a
composition of certain inflammable substances, being pierced
in the diameter of its length. It is furnished with a stick,
serving as a counter-weight, or balance, to guide it vertically
in its ascension. It carries generally different garnishes,
or furniture; as stars, serpents, fire-rains, marrons, meteors
&amp;c. which are thrown off, and produce an elegant appearance,
when it terminates its flight.</p>

<p>Rockets have been applied to several uses. Thus, the
war-rocket, as an incendiary, improved by Congreve, and
the signal rocket, are some of its applications. These, however,
are modified for the purpose, and will be spoken of
hereafter. The Indian rockets, called Fougette (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Baguette à
feu</i> of the French) will also be noticed.</p>

<p>Although as a fire-work for exhibition, the rocket may be
considered the most grand, and, especially when furnished
with various decorations, the most brilliant, yet its utility for
Military and Naval purposes is acknowledged by all.</p>

<p>When treating of sundry preliminary operations in the
second part of this work, we had occasion to introduce the
subject of rockets, as respects the formation of their cases,
the manner of charging and driving them, with the tools required,
and the boring of rockets, when they have been
driven solid. These subjects may be found in sections iv,
v, and viii. We purpose, however, to make such observations
as may, with the remarks heretofore offered, furnish
the reader with a general knowledge of the making, decorating,
and discharging of rockets. On the theory of the
ascension of rockets, motion of fire-wheels, &amp;c. and observations
on the rocket principle, consult the chapter in the
first part of the work, concerning the theory of particular
fire-works. For the manner of uniting sheets of paper of
several thicknesses, for cases, see <a href="#PASx"><i>Pasteboard</i>.</a></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. I. Of the Caliber and Proportion of Rockets.</i></p>

<p>Sky-rockets are generally made of seven calibers, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
half an inch to three inches. Different opinions have been
entertained respecting the proper proportions. Some contend
that the height should be always regulated by their exterior
diameter. On this subject, several experiments, it
seems, have been made by an experienced artist, M. Morel,
not only to determine the length, which is best calculated to
produce the maximum of ascension, but also with respect to
the length compared with the caliber of the case.</p>

<p>The following tables are necessary in the formation of rockets.
The first shows the size of the caliber of the mould, for
rockets of a pound weight, and below; and the second points
out the size required for the caliber of moulds, from one
pound to fifty pounds. A lb. rocket, it must be observed, is
that which is just capable of admitting a leaden bullet of a
pound weight, and so of the rest.</p>

<p class="center wsp pg-brk"><a name="TABx" id="TABx"></a><i>TABLE</i> I. <i>Size of the caliber of moulds of a pound weight,

<p class="p1">Here, it is evident, that the mould of a rocket of twelve
ounces in weight, ought to be seventeen lines (12 lines to
the inch) in diameter; and one of five ounces, will require a
mould of thirteen lines in diameter. Hence, we derive an
easy method of finding the size, when the weights are given:
and, if the diameter of the rocket be given, it will be equally
easy to find the weight of the ball, corresponding to the
weight of that caliber.</p>

<p class="p1">By this second table, if the weight of the ball be given,
the size of the mould may be found: suppose it be eighteen
pounds; opposite to it is the number 262. Then we say, by
the rule of proportion, (as 19<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>, see <a href="#TABx">Table 1</a>, is supposed to
be divided into a hundred parts) 100 : 19<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> : : 262 to the
fourth term sought, viz. 51.09; which gives for the required
caliber 52 lines nearly, or four inches and four lines. But
if the caliber be given in lines, the weight of the ball may
be found: suppose the given caliber be 36 lines, then as 19<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> :
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: '160'">100</ins> : : 36 : 184. The nearest number in the table to this is
181, which shows that the weight of the ball will be rather
more than 6 lbs; or, in other words, that a rocket, the diameter
or caliber of which is thirty-six lines, is a rocket of a
6 lb. ball. See <a href="#CROx"><i>Congreve Rocket</i>.</a></p>

<p>As to moulds to prevent the rockets from splitting in the
act of charging them, Morel observes, that he has never
used them. He remarks, that a case which will not resist
the force of the charge, cannot resist the violence of the fire.</p>

<p>On the subject of compositions, he observes, that he has
only employed one formula, and, of course, but one standard
proportion for all sized calibers; and is of opinion, that it is
useless to employ an inferior composition, or one with which
we are unacquainted, when we have a formula, on which we
may rely. This opinion, however, does not agree with that
of others.</p>

<p>Certain rockets, it is to be remarked, show tails of fire in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
their flight, and others again do not. This depends entirely
upon the charcoal; for, if we use charcoal, made from tender
and light wood, it burns rapidly, without producing a tail of
fire; but if we use the charcoal of oak or of beech, or of other
hard wood, the rocket will form a brilliant tail of fire, during
the whole period of its ascension. It is said, however, that
the charcoal of light wood, is lighter and more inflammable,
and for that reason, better calculated for rockets; but, so far
from producing the effect, we have mentioned, a quick combustion
ensues, leaving no ignited coal to be acted upon by
atmospheric air.</p>

<p>It is found by experiment, that even a little more or a little
less powder, gives to or takes from, the composition its
effective power; and, therefore, that the rockets, in their
flight, ascend to a greater or less height.</p>

<p>Some writers have asserted, that powder ought not to
enter into the composition of rockets; but in lieu thereof,
only its component parts. Where, we may inquire, is the
difference? The reason, however, assigned, is, that rockets
made with gunpowder and the other substances, will not
keep any time, owing to the powder becoming damp, and the
composition spoiled. But rockets which have been made in
France and carried to the East Indies, and brought back,
were found, on trial, not to have lost any of their effect.</p>

<p>Different opinions have also been entertained, respecting
the composition for the charging of rockets. Some, it appears,
would employ a composition for each rocket, according
to its caliber, pre-supposing, that the inflamed matter acquired
force by the increase of its volume; without considering,
that a large rocket has more weight than a small one, and
requires more power to raise it. Experience has demonstrated,
that a composition which will completely raise a
rocket of three-quarters of an inch, will raise, under the same
circumstances, a rocket of three inches; and, on the contrary,
that the last will ascend more slowly, in consequence of
having to encounter a greater resistance in the air, owing to
its size.</p>

<p class="p1">The charcoal ought not to be pulverized very fine. It should
be passed through a coarse wire sieve, and the impalpable
powder then separated, by submitting the sifted charcoal to
the same operation in a finer sieve. The fine charcoal may
be used for small fire-works.</p>

<p>The instructions, heretofore given, for the mixture of compositions
must be attended to; as, for instance, when we have
weighed the powder, nitre, and sulphur, the whole are to be
incorporated in a mortar, and then passed three times through
a large sieve. Afterwards add the charcoal, which is mixed
thoroughly with the hand. (See the <a href="#MIXx"><i>Mixture of Substances</i></a>,
part second). With respect to the rammers, the mode of
charging, &amp;c. see <a href="#RAMx"><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'section iv'">section iii</ins></a>, of part second.</p>

<p>In charging cases of half an inch caliber, fifteen blows
with the mallet must be given; for three-quarters of an inch,
twenty blows; for one inch, twenty-five blows; for one and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
quarter inches, thirty blows; one and a half inches, thirty-five
blows; for two inches, forty blows; and for three inches, fifty
blows;&mdash;that is to say, the number of blows must be given to
each charge put in, which ought to occupy half the interior
diameter of the case. The rammer must be frequently taken
out, and struck, so as to disengage any of the composition,
which may adhere to it. Respecting the accuracy of the
charge, see <a href="#TROx"><i>Table rocket</i></a>, in the chapter on <i>Table fire-works</i>.</p>

<p>The garnishing, or furniture, should not exceed, in any
case, one-third the weight of the rocket. The head is made
of pasteboard, first moistened, and then rolled round a conical
former. It must enter the mould, and, when inserted,
ought to be pasted round the juncture with paper. (See <a href="#RAMx">sec.
iii, and iv.</a>)</p>

<p>With respect to rocket sticks, as they are used for <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'counter-ter weights'">counter-weights</ins>,
Morel remarks, that, for rockets up to an inch
and a quarter, they may be formed of the branches of light
wood, as hazle, elder, &amp;c. and for rockets above that caliber,
heavy wood, but perfectly straight and without knots, may be
used. As a general rule, the sticks are made ten or twelve
times the length of the rocket, and in thickness about one-third
of the exterior diameter of the case. In the large end
of the stick, there is a gutter or groove, formed to receive
the rocket. When branches are used, they must also lie
straight, and cut flat at the large end, about half their thickness,
so that they may be joined to the rockets with a pack-thread,
or fine iron wire. If the stick is too weighty, it may
be shaved off the whole length. Rockets, we may remark,
that are not well balanced by the stick, will not ascend regularly.
If the stick be too light, they will rise in a zigzag
direction; but, if too heavy, their accelerated force will be
diminished, their motion slow, and, when they arrive at a
certain height, they will fall in a semicircular position. (See
section v, of this chapter, <a href="#DIMx"><i>on the Dimensions and Poise of
rocket sticks</i>.</a>)</p>

<p>We may further remark, that all rockets are formed and
proportioned by the diameter of their orifice. When the
height is six and two-thirds diameter, the foot should be one
diameter and two-thirds. The choak of the mould, if used,
is one diameter and one-third in height, which must be made
out of the same piece as the foot, and fit tight in the mould.
There must be an iron pin to keep the foot fast. The nipple
is half a diameter high, and two-thirds thick, and made of
the same metal as the piercer. The height of the piercer is
three and a half diameters, and at the bottom one-third of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
diameter thick, and from thence tapering to one-sixth of a
diameter. The best mode of fixing the piercer in the cylinder,
is to make that part below the nipple sufficiently long to
go entirely through the foot, and rivet at the bottom. The
former or roller, for the cases, is seven and a half diameters
from the handle, and its diameter is two-thirds of the bore.
The end of the former is one diameter and two-thirds long,
and of the thickness given above. The small part, which fits
in the hole in the end of the roller, when the case is pinched,
is one-sixth and one-fourth of the diameter of the mould
thick. The first drift, or rammer, must be six diameters from
the handle; and this, as well as all other rammers, must be a
little thinner than the former, to prevent the sacking of the
paper, when the charge is driven. In the end of this rammer
must be a hole to fit over the piercer. Several hollow
rammers are used in completing the charge. (See our remarks
in part second on <a href="#RAMx"><i>Charging of cases</i>.</a>)</p>

<p>The diameter of the nipple should always be equal to
that of the former. With regard to the thickness of moulds,
it is immaterial, provided they are substantial and strong.
Solid driving is more expeditious than charging over a piercer;
but great labour and attention is required in boring
them, an account of which, with the apparatus required,
may be seen in <i>Part second</i>.</p>

<p>The following table of the dimensions of rocket-moulds,
if the rockets are rammed solid, may be useful.</p>

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. III. Of the Heading of Rockets.</i></p>

<p>The heads for sky-rockets must always bear a given proportion
to the rockets.</p>

<p>A pointed cap, adapted to the summit, will make a rocket
ascend to a greater height, as it serves to facilitate its passage
through the air. To these rockets may be added several
other things; as a petard, which is a box of tin plate, filled
with fine gunpowder, placed on the summit. The petard is
put on the composition, at the end, when it has been filled,
and the remaining paper of the cartridge is folded down over
it, to keep it firm. The petard produces its effect, when the
rocket is in the air, and the composition is consumed. We
have already remarked, that the upper parts of rockets, that
is to say, their <i>heads</i>, are generally furnished with some composition,
which takes fire, when it has reached its greatest
height, emits a considerable blaze, or produces a loud report
and whizzing noise. Of this kind are saucissons, marrons,
stars, showers of fire, &amp;c. The heads of sky-rockets, are,
therefore, furnished with a variety of compositions.</p>

<p>When a rocket is five diameters, and one-sixth in length,
the case being cut to this length, after it is filled, the head
should be two diameters high, and one diameter <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub></span>th, and
<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> in breadth. The perpendicular height of the cone, or
cap of the head, must be in diameter, one, and one-third.
There is a circular collar, to which the head is fixed, turned
out of any light wood; its exterior diameter must be equal to
the interior diameter of the head. One-sixth is sufficient for
its thickness, and round the outside must be a groove. The
interior diameter of the collar should not be quite so wide as
the exterior diameter of the rocket. When it is to be glued
on the rocket, two or three rounds of paper are to be cut off,
which will make a shoulder for it to rest upon. Two or three
rounds of paper well pasted, will be sufficient for the head. Put
the collar on the mandril, or former, which must fit the inside
of the cone when formed; then, with a pinching cord, pinch
the bottom of the head into the groove, and tie it with small
twine. To make the caps, cut the paper in round pieces, equal
in diameter to twice the length of the cone, which is to be
made. These pieces, being cut into halves, will make two caps
each. Paste over the caps a thin white paper, which must be a
little longer than the cone, so as to project about half an inch
below the bottom: this projection of paper being matched and
pasted, serves to fasten the cap to the head, A conical former
is used to shape the head.</p>

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. IV. Of the Decorations for Rockets, and the Manner of
filling their Heads.</i></p>

<p>Having, in the preceding section, shown the mode of forming
heads, or conical caps, for rockets, we may now remark,
that the furniture or decorations for rockets consist of stars
of different kinds, such as tailed, brilliant, white, blue, yellow,
&amp;c. or gold and silver rain; or serpents, crackers, fire-scrolls,
or shining marrons, or small rockets; the kind of the
decoration depending entirely upon taste and fancy.</p>

<p>In loading the heads of rockets, a ladleful of powder
must be put into each head, along with the decorations.
This is absolutely necessary in order to burst the head and
disperse the stars, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Various experiments have been instituted, to make rockets,
by employing sundry compositions for charging the cases,
along with the rocket composition, to produce, like the heads
of rockets, when they burst, different appearances. M. Morel
informs us, that he made several experiments with that
view, but did not succeed. He ascribes the failure to several
causes; and, in substance, concludes, that such figures
have a greater weight than rockets are able to carry; that
their irregular forms and movements produce, in the ascension,
a contrariety of effects, which impedes their flight; and
that, if they were to succeed, the rapidity, with which the
fuse passes through the air, would prevent any thing being
distinguished. As such exhibitions are shown with effect,
by the bursting of the head of the rocket, after it has ceased
to burn; we are of opinion, that the only mode, which can
be adopted, with success, is the one already described. For
after the rocket has ceased, or finished, the last portion of
fire is communicated to the head, containing the decorations,
which is blown off, and its contents are inflamed and dispersed.
It is true, however, that, in some compositions, stars, previously
made, and therefore not mixed with the composition,
are put in the cases along with the charge: We have an instance
of this in the fire-pump, Roman candle, &amp;c. The
cases for these are filled in the following order: first with
gunpowder to a certain extent, then a star, then composition;
then powder again, then another star, and so on alternately,
until the charge is completed; but, in this instance, the star, as
well as the gunpowder, is distinct from the composition,
which forms the fire-pump. For, while the composition performs
one part, the gunpowder acts another, by throwing the
stars out, which, by their combustion, give the appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
they are intended to produce. Stars may be formed, or rather
exhibited, in this way, which, in fact is much after the
manner, in which they are used for the heads of rockets. But
the experiments of Morel appear to have been made, with
a view to produce that effect from the rocket itself, and altogether
by the composition, by varying or otherwise modifying
it. Star-composition, it must be observed, is of a greater
specific gravity than any ordinary composition, in consequence
of the weight, and quantity of metallic and other
substances, which enter into it. By arranging stars in cases,
in the mode described for the fire-pump, the effect, we have
spoken of, always takes place.  In rockets, however, which
require to be driven with considerable force, and over a
piercer, they could not be used.</p>

<p>The last column expresses the distance from the top of the
cone, where the stick, when tied on, should balance the rocket,
so as to stand in equilibrium on the edge of a knife.</p>

<p>Having given the method of preparing sticks, nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
more is necessary on that head, except that they should be
cut and planed according to the dimensions in the table. A
groove must be made the length of the rocket, and as broad
as the stick will allow. Two notches may be cut on the
opposite flat side, for the cord which ties on the rocket. The
top of the stick should always touch the head. In fixing on
the stick, care must be taken to secure it well.</p>

<p>It is the stick which gives a proper counterpoise, without
which the rockets would not ascend; and, unless they were
of a proper length and weight, instead of taking a vertical or
perpendicular direction, they would describe a parabola, or
take an oblique course, and fall to the ground.</p>

<p>A rocket stick may be made for any sized rocket, although
not expressed in the table, by assuming the data there given,
taking care to find the centre of gravity. For the sticks
for war-rockets, see <a href="#CROx"><i>Congreve Rocket</i>.</a></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VI. Of the Mode of Discharging Rockets.</i></p>

<p>Having completely prepared the rockets with all their
appendages, we consider in the next place the manner of discharging
them; in performing which some care is to be observed.
The old and heretofore common manner, of setting
them off by hanging them on nails and hooks, has many objections.
The best mode is to have a ring made of strong
iron wire, large enough for the stick to go in, as far as the
mouth of the rockets. Then let this ring be supported by a
small iron, at some distance from the post or stand, to which
it is fixed; and have another ring fixed in the same manner,
to receive and guide the small end of the stick. Rockets,
thus suspended, will have nothing to obstruct their flight.
The upright, to which the rings are fixed by the small iron,
must be exactly vertical.</p>

<p>Two, three, or more sky-rockets may be fixed on one stick,
and fired together. Their appearance, in this case, is very
striking. Their tails will seem but as one of immense size,
and the discharge from so many heads, at the same time,
will resemble more the effect of an air balloon. Rockets,
for this purpose, must be made alike in every particular. If
the rockets are half-pounders, whose sticks are six and a
half feet long, then two, or three, or six of these are to be
fixed to one stick, the length of which must be nine feet and
three-quarters. Cut the top of it into as many sides as there
are rockets, and let the length of each side be equal to the
length of one of the rockets without its head; and in each of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
these sides, let a groove be made. From this groove, plane
it round, down to the end. The rule is, that the stick at top
must be sufficiently thick, when the grooves are cut, for all
the rockets to lie as near as possible, without pressing each
other. When only two rockets are to be fixed on one stick,
let the length of the stick be the last given proportion, but
shaped after the common method, and the breadth and thickness,
double the usual dimensions.</p>

<p>When several rockets are placed upon one stick, there
will be some danger of their flying up without the stick.
Cases, when tied on all sides of the stick, cannot be secured
to it by rope passing over notches as before mentioned. Instead
of which, drive a small nail in each side of the stick,
between the necks of the cases; and let the cord, which goes
round their necks, be brought close under the nails. A
quick match, without a pipe, is to be fixed to the mouth of
one rocket, and carried to another. This match will communicate
fire at one and the same time.</p>

<p>There is a mode of discharging sky-rockets without sticks,
which consists in using balls of lead tied to a wire two or
three feet long, and fixing the other end of the wire to the
neck of the rocket. These balls answer the purpose of sticks,
when made of a proper weight, which is about <span class="xs"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span>ds the
weight of the rocket. They will balance the rocket at the
usual point. To fire rockets, thus equipped, a different mode
must be adopted. They are hung, one at a time, between the
tops of wires placed for that purpose, letting their heads rest
on the wire, and the balls hang down between them. The
wires are about three feet long, and inserted in a circle, in a
block of wood, which must lie level, and the wires perfectly
vertical. The diameter of the circle is two and a half inches;
it is divided into three equal parts, and at each one is a rod
or wire.</p>

<p>We may introduce here a description of the <i>stands for
sky-rockets</i>, and the <i>girandole chests for the flights of rockets</i>.
The first is formed of two rails of wood, of any length, supported
at each end by a perpendicular leg, so that the rails
lie horizontal; and let the distance from one to the other be
almost equal to the length of the sticks of the rockets, intended
to be fired. Then in the front of the top rail, drive square
hooks at eight inches distance, with their points turning sidewise;
so that, when the rockets are hung on them, the
points will be below the sticks, and keep them from falling
or being blown off by the wind. At the front of the rail at
the bottom must be staples, driven perpendicularly under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
hooks at top. Through these staples put the small ends of
the rocket-sticks. They are fired by applying a lighted port-fire
to their mouths. Two or three seconds will expire before
they ascend.</p>

<p><i>The girandole chest</i> is composed of four sides of equal
dimensions; but may be made of any size, according to the
number of rockets to be fired. Its height must be in proportion
to the rockets, and higher than the rockets with their
sticks. When the sides are joined, fix in the top, as far down
the chest as the length of one of the rockets with its cap
on. On this top, make as many square or round holes, to receive
the rocket-sticks, as the number of rockets to be fired;
but let the distance between them be sufficient to prevent
their touching each other. From one hole to another cut a
groove of a sufficient size for a quick match to lie in. The
top being thus fixed, put in the bottom, at about 1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> feet distance
from the feet of the chest. In this bottom, make as
many holes as at the top, and all to correspond, but not so
large as those in the top.</p>

<p>To prepare the chest, a quick match is laid in all the
grooves, from hole to hole. Then take the sky-rockets, and
prime them with meal-powder, or priming paste, as before-mentioned,
and put a bit of match up the cavity of each,
which should project out. Put the sticks of the rockets
through the holes in the top and bottom of the chest, so that
their mouths may rest on the quick match in the grooves.
The rockets will then be fired at once. There should be a
door in the side of the chest, and also a cover, to secure the
rockets until they are required.</p>

<p>The <i>fountain of rockets</i>, an exhibition which frequently
accompanies a display of works, is nothing more than a number
of rockets discharged at the same time.</p>

<p>There are some improvements on the girandole chest, and
on the different modes of discharging a series of rockets.</p>

<p>We may mention one contrivance for this purpose, as
described by Morel. It is an oblong box furnished with a
double lid, which, when shut, resembles the roof of a house.
This box is sixty inches in length, ten inches in breadth, and
nine inches in height. It rests upon a frame, and has a
bottom in which are one-hundred holes, to receive the same
number of rocket-sticks, the rockets resting on the bottom
of the box. The lid serves to prevent the access of moisture,
and to secure the rockets. No part of the rocket is
seen in the box. They are set off by first strewing meal-powder
on the bottom, which is then in contact with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
mouths, and applying a lighted port-fire. They rise out of
the box all together, and at the same time. When fired together,
so as to form a <i>flight</i> of rockets, the French use
them of three-quarters of an inch caliber.</p>

<p>The <i>girandole</i> may be considered an assemblage of a large
number of rockets of various calibers, arranged in gradation;
the largest, occupying the first range, &amp;c. The girandole
constitutes, as a fire-work, in the language of Morel, the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feux de gouvernement</i>.</p>

<p>Similar to this is a contrivance for the same purpose, but
not so extensive, and rather differently formed.  It consists
of a case, in which there are holes to receive the sticks and
support the rockets. The case is supported by legs; two of
which, working upon a joint, may be extended, and thus
the rockets be made to move in any angular direction. The
inclination given is hardly ever more than 55 degrees. The
legs are pointed, so as to retain their position. If the rockets
are to ascend vertically, the two legs, which move in a joint,
are closed. They are stuck in the ground at the same place.</p>

<p>For the mode of discharging the <i>Congreve Rocket</i>, see the
article on <a href="#CROx"><i>Congreve Rockets</i>.</a></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VII. Of the Appendages, and Combinations of Rockets.</i></p>

<p>We purpose to notice, in this section, some of the modes
of arranging, combining, and also of varying the effects of
rockets.</p>

<p>When a sky-rocket is fixed with its stick on the top of
another, a fresh tail of fire will be observable, when the second
rocket takes fire, which will mount to a great height.
The preparation of these rockets consists in filling a two
pounder only half a diameter above the piercer, (which must
be observed in this instance,) and its head with not more
than ten or twelve stars; adapting a stick as usual, which
must be made a little thicker than customary. This stick
must be cut in half the way flat, and in each half a groove,
so that, when joined together, they will receive, and be large
enough to hold the stick of a half pound rocket. The heading
is then performed as before described. The stick of this
small rocket is to be fixed in the hollow of the large one, so
far that the mouth of the rocket may rest on the head of the
two pounder; and, from the head of the two pounder, a leader
is to be carried into the mouth of the small rocket.</p>

<p>When sky-rockets are fixed one on the top of another,
they are called <i>towering rockets</i>, on account of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
height to which they ascend. They are made in the following
manner: Fix on a pound rocket, a head without a collar;
then take a four-ounce rocket, which may be headed or bounced,
and rub the mouth of it with priming paste, or meal-powder
and spirits of wine. Put it into the head of a large rocket
with its mouth downwards, previously, however, inserting
a bit of quick match in the hole made through the clay of the
pound-rocket, which match should be of a sufficient length
to go a small distance up the bore of the small rocket, to fire
it when the large one is burnt out. The four-ounce rocket being
too small to fill the head of the other, roll round it as
much tow as will make it stand upright in the centre of the
head. Then paste a single paper round the opening of the
top of the head of the large rocket. The large rocket must
have only half a diameter of charge rammed above the piercer;
for, if filled to the usual height, it would turn before the
small one takes fire, and entirely destroy the intended effect.
When one rocket is headed with another, there will be no
occasion for any <i>blowing powder</i>; for the force with which it
flies off will be sufficient to disengage it from the head of the
first fired rocket. The sticks for these rockets must be a little
longer than for those headed with stars, rain, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The <i>caduceus rockets</i> are formed of two rockets. When
attached, one on each side at the top of the stick, they form
a right angle, their mouths being equidistant from the stick.
The sticks, for this purpose, must have all their sides alike,
which should be equal to the breadth of a stick, proper for a
sky-rocket of the same weight as those intended to be used,
and to taper downwards as usual. They must be long enough
to balance them, and one length of a rocket from the cross-stick.
The cross-stick is that to which the cases are tied, and
serves to preserve them steady in that position. Each rocket,
when tied on, should form either an angle of 45, or 60
degrees with the large stick, or both together an angle of 90
or 120 degrees. The last, however, is considered a preferable
angle. When tying on the rockets, attention ought to be
paid to place their heads on the opposite sides of the cross-stick,
and their ends on the opposite sides of the long stick.
Quick-match is then to be carried from the mouth of one into
that of the other. When these rockets are to be fired, suspend
them between two hooks or nails, and apply fire to the
leader in the middle, and both will take fire at the same time.</p>

<p>The particular effect of this rocket is, that, in rising, it
forms two spiral lines, or double worms, in consequence of
their oblique position; and the counterpoise in the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
(the stick) causes them to ascend vertically. Rockets, for
this purpose, must have their ends choaked close, without
either head or bounce; for a weight at top would be an obstruction
to their mounting. They do not rise so high as single
rockets, because of their serpentine motion, and the resistance
they meet with in passing through the air. This resistance
is greater than two rockets of the same size fired
singly.</p>

<p><i>Honorary rockets</i> are nothing more than sky-rockets, except
that they carry neither head nor report. They are closed
at top, to which is attached a cone. On the case, close to
the top of the stick, a two-ounce case is tied. This last is filled
with a strong charge, and is usually about five or six
inches in length, and pinched close at both ends. At the opposite
sides, at each end, a hole must be bored, in the same
manner as in tourbillons; and from each hole, a leader must
be carried into the top of the rocket. When the rocket is
fired, and has arrived at its proper height, it will communicate
fire to the case at the top, which will cause the rocket
and stick to descend very fast to the ground, and, in its descent,
will represent a worm of fire.</p>

<p>There are several modes of placing the small case, so as
to produce the best effect. One is by letting the stick rise a
little above the top of the rocket, and tying the case to it, so
as to rest on the rocket. These rockets are not furnished
with cones. Another method is also recommended; namely,
in the top of the rocket, fix a piece of wood, in which drive
a small iron spindle; then make a hole in the middle of the
small case, through which put the spindle, and fix, on the top
of it, a nut, to keep the case from falling off. The case, by
this means, will turn very fast, without the rocket. This method,
however, is not preferred.</p>

<p>One-pound rockets are considered the best size for this
purpose.</p>

<p><i>Chained rockets</i>, as they are sometimes called, are another
modification of the manner of fixing rockets; for the intention
is to make several sky-rockets rise in the same direction, and
equally distant from each other. This effect is produced in
the following manner: Take six, or any number of sky-rockets,
of any size; then cut some strong pack-thread into pieces
of three or four yards long, and tie each end of these pieces
to a rocket in this way;&mdash;after tying one end of the pack-thread
round the body of one rocket, and the other end to
another, take a second piece of pack-thread, and make one
end of it fast to one of the rockets already tied, and the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
end to a third rocket; so that all the rockets, except the outside,
will be fastened to two pieces of pack thread. The
length of thread, from one rocket to the other, is indeterminate.
They must all be of a size, and their heads filled with
the same weight of stars, or other decorations.</p>

<p>In the mouth of each rocket, a leader is to be fixed of the
same length, and when fixed, they may be hung almost close.
Tie the ends of the leaders together, and prime them: When
this is fixed, all the rockets will mount at the same time, and
separate as far as the strings will admit. They will preserve
the same order and distance, if they are rammed alike, and
equally well made.</p>

<p>The manner of dividing the tail of a sky-rocket, so as to
form an arch when ascending, is thus performed. Having
some rockets made, and headed according to fancy, and tied
on their sticks, get some sheet tin, and cut it into round
pieces of about three or four inches in diameter. Then, on
the stick of each rocket, under the mouth of the case, fix one
of these pieces of tin, sixteen inches from the head of the
rocket, and support it by a wooden bracket as strong as possible.
The use of this is, that, when the rocket is ascending,
the fire will play with great force on the tin, which will divide
the tail in such a manner, as to form an arch. If there
is a short piece of port-fire, of a strong charge, tied to the
end of the stick, it will add greatly to the appearance; but
this must be lighted before fire is put to the rocket.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VIII. Of Swarmers, or Small Rockets.</i></p>

<p>Although swarmers are nothing more than rockets of a
smaller size, as from two ounces downwards, and are charged
with the usual rocket composition, which we have <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'des-scribed'">described</ins>;
yet it may be necessary to make some remarks respecting
them.</p>

<p>Swarmers are sometimes fired in flights, or in a volley,
and in large aquatic fire-works. They are bored in the same
manner as large rockets, or pierced in the act of charging
them. This is the case with those of one and two ounces.
All rockets, however, under one ounce, are not bored, but
must be filled to the usual height with composition. The
number of strokes for ramming these small swarmers is not
material, provided they are rammed true and moderately
hard. The necks of unbored rockets must be in the same
proportion as in common cases. The composition, with which
small swarmers are charged, generally consists of</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">

<tr><td class="tdl">Charcoal, or steel-dust,</td><td class="tdl">¼</td><td class="tdl">oz.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="p1">As to the swarmers which are pierced, or bored, <i>viz.</i> those
of one and two ounces; they are made, we observed, in the
same manner as large rockets, with the exception, that, when
headed, their heads must be put on without a collar. The
number of strokes for driving one-ounce cases must be eight,
and for two-ounce, twelve.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. IX. Of Scrolls for Sky-Rockets, and of Strung, Tailed,
Drove, and Rolling Stars.</i></p>

<p>We have given, in a preceding chapter, the composition of
various stars, which are used for the decoration of sky-rockets,
and other species of fire-works. We shall, therefore,
confine ourselves to their application, and the different modes
of preparing them for this purpose.</p>

<p><i>Scrolls</i> are used as furniture, or decorations for sky-rockets,
and are so named from the spiral form they assume,
when fired very quick in the air. We may put into the head
of a rocket, as many of the cases as it will contain. Cases
for scrolls should be four or five inches in length, and their
interior diameter, three-eighths of an inch. One end of these
cases must be pinched quite close before it is filled; and,
when filled, the other end must also be closed. Then, in the
opposite sides, make a small hole at each end, in the same
manner as in tourbillons, and prime them with priming paste,
or meal-powder and brandy.</p>

<p><i>Strung Stars</i>, so named from having a cotton quick match
run through them, are formed by taking some thin paper,
and cutting it into pieces of about one and a half inches
square, and laying on each piece, as much dry star composition
as the paper, when folded, will easily contain. The paper,
with its contents, is then twisted up as hard as possible.
When done, rub some paste between the hands, and roll the
stars between them, and afterwards dry them. They are
then covered with tow, and primed with a paste composed
of meal powder, and brandy, in which they may be rolled
in the same manner as described when treating of stars.
They are then dried and strung on cotton quickmatch, by
piercing a hole through them, taking care to put but ten or
twelve on each match, and placing them at the distance of
three or four inches apart.</p>

<p><i>Tailed stars</i> are those which produce a great many sparks,
representing a tail like that of a comet. Of these, there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
two kinds, the rolled and the drove. The operation for the
rolling of stars, we have sufficiently explained; it consists
in mixing the composition with brandy, or, if it can be had,
with spirit of wine, and either weak gum water, or isinglass
size, sufficient to make a thick paste; and then rolling it.</p>

<p>When tailed stars are to be driven, the composition must
be moistened with spirit of wine, or if it cannot be had, with
fourth proof brandy, without the gum, or gelatin, and not
made so wet as for rolling. One or two-ounce cases, rolled
dry, are best for this purpose; and when they are filled, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'unrol'">unroll</ins>
the cases within three or four rounds of the charge, and
all that is unrolled must be cut off. Then paste down the
loose edge; and in two or three days afterwards, cut them
in pieces of five or six-eighths of an inch in length; then melt
some wax, and dip one end of each piece into it, so as to
cover the composition. The other end must be covered
with priming paste.</p>

<p><i>Drove stars</i> are so designated, because the composition is
always drove, and used in cases. They are seldom put in
rockets, but are chiefly used for air-balloons. They are put
in cases, to prevent the composition from being broken, by
the force of the blowing powder in the shell. See <a href="#MORy"><i>Air-Balloons</i>.</a></p>

<p>With respect to <i>rolling stars</i>, we gave, in our chapter on
star compositions, not only the proportion of their constituent
parts, but ample instructions for preparing them for use.
They are usually about the size of a musket ball; but sometimes
they are made an inch in diameter. When very small,
they are called <i>sparks</i>. See <a href="#STAx"><i>Stars</i>.</a></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. X. Of Line-Rockets and their Decorations.</i></p>

<p>Line-rockets are the same as the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'couratines'">courantines</ins></i> of the French,
or rockets that fly along a rope. If a rocket be attached to
an empty case, and a rope passed through the latter, and
stretched horizontally; and if the rocket be then set on fire,
it will run along the rope, without stopping till the matter it
contains is exhausted.</p>

<p>Line-rockets do not differ materially from sky-rockets, as
they are made and driven like them; but they are without
heads, and the cases are cut close to the clay. They are
sometimes made with six or seven changes. Four or five,
however, are the most common. We must first have a
piece of light wood, turned round, about two and a half
inches in diameter, with a hole through the middle, lengthwise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
and sufficiently large for a wire to go easily through.
If four changes are required, four grooves must be cut in the
swivel, one opposite the other, to lay the rockets in.</p>

<p>Having rubbed the mouths of the rockets with wet meal
powder, lay them in the grooves, head to tail, and tie them
fast. From the tail of the first rocket, carry a leader to the
mouth of the second, and from the second to the third, and
so on to as many as there are on the swivel, making every
leader very secure; but in fixing these pipes, care must be
taken, that the quick match does not enter the calibers of
the rockets. The rockets being fixed on the swivel and
ready to be fired, have a line, 100 yards long, stretched, and
fixed up tight, at any height from the ground, but placed
perfectly horizontal. This length of line will answer for
half-pound rockets, but, if larger, the line must be longer.
One end of the line, before it is put up, is to be put through
the swivel; and when the line-rocket is fired, let the mouth
of that rocket, which is set off first, face that end of the line
where the operator stands, and the effect will follow in succession,
<i>viz</i>: the first rocket will carry the rest to the other
end of the line, the second will bring them back, and they
will continue running out and in, according to the number
of rockets. At each end of the line, there must be a piece
of wood for the rocket to strike against, to prevent injury to
the line. Let the line be well soaped, and the hole in the
swivel very smooth.</p>

<p>In order to vary the appearance, different decorations
may be used with the line-rockets; of these, <i>flying dragons</i>,
<i>Mercuries</i>, &amp;c. are the most conspicuous. Another motion
may be given to them, that of revolving, in the following
manner: Have a flat swivel, made very exact, and tie on it
two rockets obliquely, one on each side; which will make it
turn the whole length of the line, and form a circle of fire.
The charge for these rockets, should be a little weaker than
that usually employed.</p>

<p>It is apparent, that a variety of figures may be put in motion,
and consequently new appearances formed, by different
contrivances. To represent, for instance, two <i>fighting dragons</i>,
we must have two swivels, made square; and on each
swivel, tie three rockets together, on the under side. Then
having two flying dragons, made of tin, fix one of them on
the top of each swivel, so as to stand upright, and in the
mouth of each dragon, put a case of common fire; and
another at the end of the tail. Two or three port-fires may
also be put on the sides of their bodies to illuminate them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
Put them on the line, one at each end; but let there be a
swivel in the middle of the line, to keep the figures from
striking together. Before the rockets are fired, light the cases
on the dragons, and, if care be taken in firing both at the
same time, they will meet in the middle of the line. They
will then turn, and run back with great violence. The line
for these rockets, must be very long.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XI. Of Signal Sky-Rockets.</i></p>

<p>Signal rockets seldom exceed a pound in weight. Those
which are employed in the land and sea service, are sometimes
capped, or headed, and contain stars, serpents, &amp;c.
Two sorts of signals are used when artificial works are to be
exhibited; namely, one with serpents, and the other without.
Rockets which are to be bounced, must have their cases made
one and a half or two diameters longer than the common
proportion, and, after they are filled, a small quantity of clay
is put in. Then bounce and pinch them in the usual manner,
and fix on each a cap. Signal sky-rockets, without
bouncers, are only sky-rockets closed and capped. These
are very light, and, therefore, do not require such heavy
sticks as those with loaded heads. Signal rockets, with reports,
are fired in small flights; and are often, as well as
those without reports, used for signals of the commencement
of an exhibition of fire-works.</p>

<p>Signal rockets may be seen at a great distance, and observed
instantly, when neither flags nor telegraphs could be
observed without glasses; and may be so formed, as even to
communicate particular orders or intelligence, by varying
their decorations, their mode of ascension, as in the caduceus
rocket, and by several other means.</p>

<p class="center">OF SUNDRY FIRE-WORKS, DENOMINATED AIR-WORKS.</p>


<p>Before we notice the various kinds of wheel-works, and
their appendages, we purpose to consider the formation of
gerbes, air-balloons, mortars, bombs, tourbillons, aigrettes,
and some other works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. I. Of the Composition and Mode of forming large and
small Gerbes.</i></p>

<p>In preparing cases for gerbes, it is necessary that they
should be made strong; as they would be liable to burst, on
account of the strength of the composition, which comes out
with great velocity. They should be of the same thickness
at top and bottom, and the paper well pasted. Their necks
should be long, in which case, the iron would have more
time to be heated, by meeting with more resistance in its
disengagement, than if the neck was shorter; for then it would
be burnt too wide before the charge was consumed. Long
necks will throw the stars to a greater height, which will
not fall before they are spent. They should rise and spread
in such a manner as to resemble a wheat-sheaf.</p>

<p>Gerbes are generally made about six diameters long, from
the bottom to the top of the neck. Their caliber must be
one-fifth narrower at top than at bottom. Their neck is one-sixth
diameter, and three-fourths long. There is a wooden
foot or stand, on which the gerbe rests. This may be made
with a choak or cylinder, four or five inches long, to fit the
inside of the case, or with a hole in it to put in the gerbe:
both these methods will answer the same end. In the charging
of gerbes, there will be no need of a mould, the cases
being sufficiently strong to support themselves. Before this
operation is commenced, we must be provided with a piece
of wood made to fit in the neck. If this precaution is not
used, the composition will fall into the neck, and occasion a
vacancy in the case, which will inevitably burst it, the moment
the fire reaches the air. A weak composition should be
put in at first, to the quantity of one or two ladles full. After
the case is filled, take out the piece of wood, and fill the
neck with slow charge.</p>

<p>Small gerbes, or white fountains, as they are sometimes
called, are usually made of four, eight, or sixteen ounce
cases, of any length, taking care to paste, and otherwise
make them very strong. Before they are filled, however,
drive in clay one diameter of their orifice high. When filled,
bore a hole through the centre of the clay to the composition.
The ordinary proportion will answer for the vent, which
must be primed with a slow charge. Large gerbes are made
by their diameters, and their cases at bottom one-fourth
thick. The interior diameter of a gerbe is found, by supposing
the exterior diameter of the case, when made, to be five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
inches, by taking two-fourths for the sides of the case, and
there will remain two and a half inches for the bore.</p>

<p>Gerbes produce a brilliant fire, and appear remarkably
beautiful, when a number of them are fixed in front of a
building.</p>

<p>The composition of gerbes is similar to that of the Chinese
fire. It is to the cast-iron, which enters into it, that its beautiful
effects are to be ascribed. In fact, the composition of Chinese
fire differs considerably, as we shall notice, when we
treat of it, according to the purpose for which it is employed.
It is adapted, for instance, in various proportions of its
constituent parts, to calibers of different diameters, cascades,
representation of palm trees, as well as for large and small
gerbes. The old formula for gerbes is the following.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Composition for Gerbes.</i></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl wd70">Meal-powder,</td><td class="tdl wd3">6</td><td class="tdl wd5">lbs.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Beat cast-iron,</td><td class="tdl">2</td><td class="tdl">lbs.</td><td class="tdl wd5">1½</td><td class="tdl wd5">oz.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="p1">The present formula, as we remarked when speaking of
compositions for calibers from three-quarters of an inch to
an inch, is saltpetre 1 oz, sulphur 1 oz, meal-powder 8 oz,
charcoal 1 oz, and pulverized cast-iron 8 oz.</p>

<p>The vivid and rapid combustion which ensues, when this
composition is inflamed, cannot be accounted for in any other
way, than that the nitre is acted upon by the sulphur, the
charcoal, and the iron; that the gunpowder, during its combustion,
raises the temperature to the degree necessary for
the decomposition of the nitre by the substances mentioned;
that sulphurous and probably sulphuric acid, as well as
carbonic acid, are generated, by the union of the sulphur and
carbon with a part of the oxygen of the nitre; that the iron
undergoes a combustion, both in contact with the nitre and
with atmospheric air; and, lastly, that the <i>effect</i>, which characterizes
this composition, and other similar compositions,
into which cast-iron enters, as in the celebrated Chinese fire,
is to be attributed to the iron; and the appearance which iron
assumes, when in a state of combustion, is owing to no
other cause than its rapid combination with oxygen, by which
the metal is oxidized. (See <a href="#IROx"><i>Iron</i></a>, in <i>Part</i> I.)</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="MORx" id="MORx"></a><i>Sec. II. Of Paper Mortars.</i></p>

<p>It may not be improper, in this place, to give the manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
of forming paper mortars. These mortars are necessary for
a variety of exhibitions, as will appear hereafter.</p>

<p>Mortars are made of stout paper; or several sheets are
pasted together, and made into pasteboard, in the manner
before described. (See <a href="#PASx"><i>Pasteboard</i>.</a>) The preparations are
various according to the size required. For a coehorn mortar,
which is 4 inches and <span class="xs"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>5</sub></span>ths in diameter, roll the pasteboard
on the former, on which it is made, <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub></span>th of its diameter
thick, and, when dry, cut one end smooth and even; then
nail and glue it on the upper part of the foot. Afterwards
cut off the pasteboard at the top, allowing for the length of
the mortar, two and a half diameters from the mouth of the
powder chamber.</p>

<p>The mortar is then bound round with a strong cord, wetted
with glue. The bottom of the foot, it being turned out of
elm, is one diameter and two thirds broad, and one diameter
high, and the part which goes into the mortar is two-thirds
of its diameter in height. The copper chamber for
the powder, which is separate from this, is made in a conical
form, and is one-third of the diameter wide, and one and
a half of its own diameter long. In the centre of the bottom
of this chamber, make a small hole, a short distance down
the foot; this hole must be met by another of the same size,
made in the side of the foot. If these holes are made true,
and a copper pipe fitted into both, the mortar, when loaded,
will prime itself; for the powder will naturally fall to the
bottom of the first hole. By putting a piece of quick match
to the side, it will be prepared for firing.</p>

<p>When mortars of a larger size than ten inches in diameter
are required, it is better to have them made of brass. See
further observations on this subject in section seventh of
this chapter, in the article on <a href="#FIRx"><i>fire-pots</i>.</a></p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="MORy" id="MORy"></a><i>Sec. III. Of Mortars to throw Aigrettes, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Shells are filled with a variety of pyro-preparations, as
stars, rains, serpents, &amp;c. These are put in first, and then
the blowing powder, as it is called; but the shells must not
be quite filled. They must be introduced into the shells
through the fuse hole. Some substances, however, as marrons,
being too large to go through the fuse hole, must be
put in before the shell is closed. When the shells are loaded,
glue and drive in the fuses very tight. With respect to
the diameter of the fuse hole; for a coehorn balloon, let the
diameter be seven-eighths of an inch; for a balloon, five and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
half inches in diameter, make the fuse hole one inch and one-sixth
in diameter; for an eight-inch balloon, one inch and
three-eighths; and for a ten-inch balloon, one inch and five-eighths.</p>

<p><a name="BALx" id="BALx"></a>
Air-balloons are divided, according to the substances
they contain, or the effect they are to produce, and are
usually of four kinds; namely, 1. Illuminated air-balloons, 2.
Balloons of serpents, 3. Balloons of reports, marrons, and
crackers, 4. Compound balloons. Balloons and shells, in fire-works,
are the same.</p>

<p>In the following view of the different balloons, we have
given the number and quantity of each article for the different
shells, designating their kind and character:</p>

three diameters; or with 2 oz. cases, first filled one diameter
with gold fire, then one and one-fourth diameters of brilliant
fire. These cases must be well secured at top of the charge,
lest they should take fire at both ends: but their necks must
be larger than the common proportion. For the manner of
forming <i>balloon cases</i> of paper, consult the article on that subject,
in a preceding chapter.</p>

<p>Balloons, the <i>bombs</i> of some, may be formed of different
sizes, and made proportionably strong.</p>

<p>Bombs may be formed of wood by turning it round, and
hollow, of a sufficient thickness, and in two parts, which fit
each other like a common snuff box. The inferior or lower
part must be made thicker than the upper, as it rests upon
the powder; and for the same reason, that iron bombs are
cast thicker at their bottom. One-twelfth of the diameter is
considered a sufficient thickness for the under part, and one-fifteenth
for the upper part, which is pierced with a hole to
receive the fuse. This hole is called the eye of the bomb.</p>

<p>When balloons, or bombs, are to be charged, the decorations
may be varied in the same manner as for sky-rockets.
Stars, golden rain, and meteors, are considered the best, as
they produce the most brilliant effect.</p>

<p>After the addition of the furniture or decorations, we finish
the charge by putting in coarse grain powder, which is introduced
through the eye. The fuse is then driven in. It is
glued, in order to secure it. The bomb is now covered with
three or four turns of canvass, and over this some paper, to
secure it. In this state, it ought not to be more than <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>11</sub></span>th of
an inch smaller than the caliber of the mortar. This leaves
what is denominated the windage.</p>

<p>When the bombs are well dried, the fuse is primed with
a double match, and priming paste. A cup, made with two
turns of paper, is then attached to the fuse, which receives
the double match.</p>

<p>The bomb, thus prepared, is then placed in a cone made
of pasteboard, which contains the powder of the charge, or
that required for its ascension, and is put into the mortar.
One of the matches above described, communicates the fire
to the fuse, and the other at the same time to the powder
in the cone. The match, it is to be observed, comes out of
the mouth of the mortar, and serves to fire it. This mode of
discharging the mortar, differs from the one we have previously
given.</p>

<p>The following table exhibits the calibers for bombs, the
length of the fuse for each caliber, and the weight of the
powder required for the charge.</p>

<p class="p1">Having made some remarks respecting bombs, we will now
offer a few observations concerning mortars; and although
we have, on a former occasion, mentioned something respecting
them, yet we deem a few remarks on this head not
improper at this time.</p>

<p><i>Mortars</i>, from five to six inches bore, are usually made of
pasteboard and canvass. The canvass is first soaked in a gelato-amylaceous
paste, or paste composed of half glue and
half flour; and, when put on, is covered with sheets of pasteboard,
which are glued or pasted. For various kinds of paste,
see <a href="#PASx"><i>Pasteboard</i>.</a></p>

<p>When the case, or mortar is to be formed, cylinders of
wood as <i>formers</i> are employed. They are of different diameters,
according to the size of the mortars, that are to be made.
For four-inch mortars, inch formers; for six-inch, one and a
half inch formers, &amp;c. After they are rolled and pasted on
the former, they are dried on it. As to their strength, this
depends on the thickness of the case. A mortar of four
inches in interior diameter, ought to be six inches in exterior
diameter, and those of six in interior, should be nine,
exterior. The cases being formed, we next have turned as
many cylinders of walnut, as cases or pots. These cylinders
are short. In each is formed a conical chamber, in the shape
of the letter V, which is afterwards lined with tin or brass,
to prevent the action of the powder. They are then glued
and put into the end of each pot, about the length of an
inch, and further secured by nails.</p>

<p>The chamber is designed to receive the powder, and its
conical form enables it to act with all its force immediately
on the bomb. A flat bottom would not have this advantage,
as the powder in that case would have more room, and consequently
its force be divided. They are sometimes, however,
made flat.</p>

<p>The charge for these mortars, as a general rule, is <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>30</sub></span>th
part of the weight of the bomb.</p>

<p>When mortars are to be larger than the sizes we have mentioned,
it is necessary to have them of metal, and for this
purpose copper is generally employed. Its thickness should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
be one-fourth of an inch, for a nine-inch mortar; and half an
inch, for twelve-inch mortars. A cone of copper is to be
made in the same way as above mentioned. This is secured,
and made solid by means of lead.</p>

<p>In experiments and exhibitions, the powder, we may observe,
must be of the same strength.</p>

<p>We find then, that mortars, for the discharge of bombs, or
balloons, are differently made from those which are used for
throwing iron-shells. In fire-works, the design of mortars is
to project the balloon in a vertical direction, which, being furnished
with a fuse as in ordinary shells, receives the fire from
the gun-powder; and at a given time, according to the length
of the fuse, the fire is communicated to the balloon, which
bursts and scatters its contents in the atmosphere. The furniture
for balloons being various, and in a larger quantity
than could be contained in the heads of rockets, (except the
Congreve,) the appearance is more grand and impressive. It
is obvious, that, when they burst, fire is communicated to the
whole at the same time; and the quantity of powder is usually
sufficient, not only to burst the shell, but also to throw the
contents to some distance. The height, to which balloons ascend,
depends, of course, on the quantity of gunpowder put
in the mortar. The quantity is generally regulated.</p>

<p>We find, also, that two modes are used for discharging
the mortars. The one consists in having a communication
from without to the bottom of the cone, which contains the
powder, and applying the match to this vent, on the same
principle as that for firing a cannon, or common mortar. The
other, by firing a quick-match in the conical cavity, and putting
in the charge with the balloon; letting the match, however,
be of a sufficient length to come out of the mouth of
the mortar, and fall over its side. This match, when fired,
will communicate fire to the powder in the cone, and produce
the same effect. Metallic cylinders, and especially copper,
however small, are certainly preferable to those made in the
usual manner.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. IV. Of making Balloon Fuses.</i></p>

<p>Wood, particularly beech, is generally employed for forming
fuses, which is turned of the shape required. If made
with pasted paper, they will answer for the purpose of fire-works.
The diameter of the former for fuses for coehorn
balloons must be half an inch; for a republican fuse, five-eighths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
of an inch; for an eight-inch fuse, three-fourths of an
inch; and for a ten inch fuse, seven-eighths of an inch. Having
rolled the cases, pinch and tie them almost close at one
end; then drive them down, and let them dry. Before they
are filled, mark on the outside of the case, the length of the
charge required, allowing for the thickness of the bottom;
and when the composition is rammed in, take two pieces of
quick-match about six inches long, and lay one end of each on
the charge, and then a little meal-powder, which is to be rammed
down loose. The loose ends of the match, double up, and
place in the top of the fuse. This top must be covered with
a proper cap to keep it dry. When the shells are put into the
mortars, uncap the fuses, and pull out the loose ends of the
match, and let them hang on the sides of the balloon. The
use of the match is to receive the fire from the powder in
the chamber of the mortar, in order to light the fuse. When
the shell is put in the mortar, its fuse must be uppermost,
and exactly in the centre. Some meal-powder is usually
sprinkled upon it.</p>

<p>Fuses of wood are longer than those of paper, and not
bored through, but left solid about <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> an inch at bottom; so
that, when used, this end is cut off. They are sawed, however,
at a proper length, measuring the charge from the cup
at top. On the subject of <i>Fuses</i>, see <a href="#FUSx">the last part</a> of the work.</p>

<p>Fuses for bombs, Morel remarks, are formed of five
thicknesses of paper, or of pasteboard, made of that thickness;
and the former, on which the fuse case is rolled, should
be one-third diameter. The composition is put in with a
spoon, and each charge is driven with twenty strokes of a
moderate size mallet.</p>

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. V. Of the Mosaic and Common Tourbillon.</i></p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tourbillon de feu</i> of the French, or whirlwind of fire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
is the same as the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soleil montant</i>; because it ascends in full
illumination, and scatters fire in various directions. The
tourbillon, therefore, receives its name from the effect it
produces. It raises itself very high, and forms a whirl of
fire and terminates in two coronal figures, or crowns, which
descend in what are called parasols. It does not, however,
produce crowns, except when it is charged with Chinese fire.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of tourbillons, which we will describe,
namely, the mosaic and the common. The mosaic
produces a tail of some length, and after whirling round,
finishes with a report. This effect is owing to its particular
structure and formation, as it differs from the common tourbillon.
In preparing the cases for mosaic tourbillons, pasteboard,
formed of five sheets of paper, is used. They are
made seven inches in length upon a roller or former <span class="xs"><sup>5</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>ths
of an inch in diameter. Their <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'thicknes'">thickness</ins>, when rolled, is <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>th
of an inch. They are choaked in the usual manner, and
the excess of the string is cut off. After having put a
quarter of an inch of earth into a case, and beating it with
ten or twelve blows with the mallet, we mark the height
of the earth on the outside of the case. We then load it
to the height of <span class="xs"><sup>7</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>ths with the composition heretofore
mentioned. Another quarter of a spoonful of earth is then
put in. We then choak, and bind the case in this place.
Two fingers of grain powder are now added; we again
choak, and bind it above this. We put in the same composition,
after the last operation, to the height of <span class="xs"><sup>7</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>ths of an
inch. The choaking, it is to be observed, must not wholly close
the case; so that the composition can set fire to the powder.</p>

<p>We now introduce a spoonful of earth, and choak and bind
as before. It is then finished by charging it with <span class="xs"><sup>7</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>ths
of an inch of composition. The remainder of the case is
cut, and the composition primed.</p>

<p>Cases, thus prepared, are afterwards treated in the following
manner: We pierce three holes in the sides of each,
one a little above the last choak, another through, or into
the case, to penetrate the last charge, and the third through
the first charge. These holes have a communication with
each other by means of quickmatch; so that, when the match
is set on fire, the two extremes are inflamed at the same
time, and being opposed to each other, give a rotary motion
to the tourbillon, which, when the powder inflames, terminates
by an explosion. The holes ought to be covered with three
or four turns of pasted paper. It is then ready to be put into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pots de chasse</i>. When completed, the tourbillon should
not exceed <span class="xs"><sup>10</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>ths of an inch in diameter.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pots de chasse</i> (mortars somewhat similar to those
described) should be made of pasteboard, prepared with
eight thicknesses of paper, and moulded upon a roller of
<span class="xs"><sup>11</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>ths of an inch in diameter. They are mounted in the
same manner as <i>fire-pots</i>, and are also primed in the same
way.</p>

<p>Into each pot there is put four drachms of broken grain
powder, and a slip of pasteboard, pierced with five or six
holes, which is introduced by means of a stick. A little
meal-powder is then put into the pot, and afterwards the
tourbillon, the primed end of which must be above the
<i>chasse</i>. It is then closed with paper, made into a wad or
ball, and the pot is secured with a slip of pasteboard, pasted
on it.</p>

<p class="p1">Common tourbillons differ in many respects from the mosaic,
although their motion is the same. There are two
methods of forming them as well as their appendages, both
of which we purpose to describe. The first is the following:
Having filled some cases within about 1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> diameters,
drive in a handful of clay, prepared, of course, in the manner
described in the first part of the work; then pinch their
ends close, and drive them down with a mallet. Then find
the centre of gravity of each case; where you nail and tie a
stick, which should be <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> an inch broad at the middle, and
run a little narrower to the ends; these sticks must have
their ends turned upwards, so that the cases may turn horizontally
on their centres. At the opposite sides of the cases,
at each end, bore a hole close to the clay, with a gimblet the
size of the neck of a common case of the same nature. From
these holes, draw a line round the case, and, at the under
part of the case, bore a hole with the same gimblet, within
half a diameter of each line, towards the centre; then from
one hole to the other, draw a right line. This line divide
into three equal parts, and bore a hole near to each of the
ends; then from these holes to the other two, lead a quick-match,
over which paste a thin paper.</p>

<p>It is to be observed, that there is a stick about the length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
of the case, which goes across it, and is securely fastened by
a cord, that the whole lies flat upon a table before it is fired,
and hence, it is sometimes named the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table tourbillon</i>; and,
that the leader should be carried from one side hole to the
other, the holes being made at the opposite sides, as before
mentioned. When tourbillons are fired, they must lay upon
a smooth table, with their sticks downwards, the leader being
set on fire in the middle with a port fire. They should
spin two, three, or four seconds round the table, before they
rise, which is about the time the composition will be burning
from the side holes to those at the bottom.</p>

<p>Reports, or detonating cases, may be fixed to tourbillons,
if so required. In this case, we make a small hole in the
centre of the case at top, and in the middle of the report
make another. Then place them together, and tie on the
report, and, with a single paper, secure it from fire. By this
method, small cases of stars, rains, &amp;c. may be fixed on
tourbillons, being careful, nevertheless, that they are not
overloaded.</p>

<p>One-eighth will be a sufficient thickness for the sticks, and
their length equal to that of the cases.</p>

<p>The other mode of forming common tourbillons, is the
following: They are made with cases of an inch, which are
choaked and bound in the usual manner. In filling, we
make two wads of paper of the same size, and put one of
them into the case, and ram it with fifteen or twenty blows.
We then mark upon the case, the height of this wad, which
is afterwards driven with the composition, given at the end
of this section. To each charge, thirty strokes of a moderate
size mallet, will be required; and each charge should not
be more in height in the case than nine exterior diameters.
We mark, on the outside of the case, the height of this
charge, and put in a wad of the same kind and size as the
former one. We drive this in the same manner as the first,
and then choak and bind the case. After cutting off the excess
of the ligature, with which we bound the case, we again
introduce the rammer, and give it eighteen blows with the
mallet, in order to flatten the choak.</p>

<p>We afterwards divide the case parallel to each end, into
four equal parts, and mark the height of the wads. That of
the middle, which becomes in fact the bottom of the case,
(from the manner it is fixed for ascension), we divide into
five equal parts from one point to the other, and pierce a
hole in each division to the composition. We then make,
on a level with the wads, upon the lateral lines, two similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
holes; one upon one side, and the other on the other side,
at the opposite ends. These holes are so made as that the
case has four holes on one line, and one upon each of the
other two. Each hole is then primed with a piece of quick
match, and priming paste. One of these matches must pass
over all the other holes; so that the fire may be communicated
from one to the other at the same time. The matches
are then covered with a band of pasted paper. To hold the
tourbillon in a horizontal position, we procure a hoop of the
same thickness and diameter as the length of the case; and
on the plate, we make a groove for the match of communication,
which is supported between the four holes with an iron
wire. If the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'case whirl'">case whirls</ins> round with a uniform motion, it is
well balanced.</p>

<p>The four holes beneath, serve to raise it in the air, and the
two lateral apertures give it a revolving motion.</p>

<p>When tourbillons are to be set off, they must be balanced
either by a cross stick, as in the first instance, or some other
contrivance. The effect is the same as before described.</p>

<p class="centerx"><a name="POTx" id="POTx"></a><i>Sec. VI. Of Mortars for throwing Aigrettes, and the manner
of loading and firing them.</i></p>

<p>Pots of aigrette, when inflamed, exhibit the appearance of
an aigrette, or cluster of rays, such as are produced by diamonds,
when they are arranged in a particular way. The
aigrette takes its name from a bird, whose feathers serve to
make up an ornament for the head. It was given in diamonds,
as a particular mark of distinction, by the Grand Signior,
to Lord Nelson, after the battle of the Nile. There
are aigrettes made of glass.</p>

<p>For the purpose of throwing aigrettes, the mortars are
generally made of pasteboard, of the same thickness as balloon
mortars, and two and a half diameters long in the inside
from the top of the foot. The latter must be made of elm
without a chamber, but flat at top, in the same proportion as
those for balloon mortars. These mortars must be bound
round with a cord as before mentioned. Sometimes eight or
nine of these mortars, of about three or four inches in diameter,
are bound altogether, so as to appear as one; but when
they are prepared for this purpose, the bottom of the foot
must be of the same diameter as the mortars, and only one-half
a diameter high. Having bound the mortars together,
fix them on a heavy solid block of wood. To load them,
place over the inside bottom of each, a piece of paper, and
spread on it one and a half ounces of meal and grain powder
mixed; then tie the serpents up in parcels with quickmatch,
and put them in with their mouths downwards. Care must
be taken, that the parcels do not fit too tight in the mortars,
and that all the serpents have been well primed, or wetted
with the paste of meal powder and spirit of wine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>On the top of the serpents, in each mortar, lay some paper
or tow; then carry a leader from one mortar to the other,
and from all the outside mortars to that in the middle. These
leaders are to be put between the cases and the sides of the
mortar, down to the powder at bottom. In the centre of
the middle mortar, fix a fire pump, or brilliant fountain, and
sufficiently long to project out of the mouth of the mortar.
Then secure the mortars, by pasting paper over their tops.</p>

<p>The <i>nest of serpents</i> (as mortars thus prepared are called)
is fired by lighting the fire-pump, which, when consumed,
will communicate to all the mortars at once by means of the
leaders.</p>

<p>Single mortars are called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pots des aigrettes</i>. If the mortars,
when loaded, are sent to any distance, or liable to be
much moved, the firing powder should be secured from getting
amongst the serpents, which would endanger the mortars,
as well as injure their performance. To prevent this
accident, the mortars are to be loaded in the following manner;
First, put in the firing powder, and spread it equally;
then cut a round piece of blue touch paper, equal to the exterior
diameter of the mortar, and draw a circle on it
equal to its interior diameter, and notch it as far as that circle:
then paste that part, which is notched, and put it in the
mortar close to the powder, and stick the pasted edge to the
mortar. This will secure the powder at the bottom, so that
it may be moved and carried without receiving any damage.</p>

<p>For mortars of six, eight, or ten inches diameter, the serpents
should be made in one and two-ounce cases, six or
seven inches long, and fired by a leader, brought out of the
mouth of the mortar, and turned down the outside; its end
being covered with paper, to prevent the sparks of the other
works from setting it on fire. For a six-inch mortar, let the
quantity of powder for firing be two ounces; for an eight-inch,
two ounces and three-quarters; and for a ten-inch, three
ounces and three-quarters. Care must be taken in these, as
well as small mortars, not to put the serpents in tight, for fear
of bursting the mortars. These mortars may be loaded with
stars, crackers, &amp;c.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VII. Of Making, Loading, and Firing Pots des Brins.</i></p>

<p>These are formed of pasteboard, and must be rolled pretty
thick. They are usually made three or four inches in
diameter, and four diameters long; and pinched at one end
like common cases. A number of these are placed on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
plank in the following manner: Having fixed on a plank two
rows of wooden pegs, cut, in the bottom of the plank, a groove
the whole length, under each row of pegs. Then through
the centre of each peg, bore a hole down to the groove at
bottom, and, on every peg, fix and glue a pot, whose mouth
must fit tight on the peg. Through all the holes, run a quick-match,
one end of which must go into the pot, and the other
into the groove, having a match laid in the groove from end
to end, and covered with paper; so that, when lighted at one
end, it may discharge the whole almost at the same instant.
In all the pots, put about one ounce of meal and grained
powder. Then in some put stars, and in others rains, snakes,
serpents, crackers, &amp;c. When they are all loaded, paste
paper over their mouths. Two or three hundred of these
pots being fired together, make a brilliant appearance by affording
so great a variety of fires.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="FIRx" id="FIRx"></a><i>Sec. VIII. Remarks respecting Fire Pots.</i></p>

<p>Fire pots, called also <i>pots of ordnance</i>, in pyrotechny, are
nothing more than vessels used in, as well as for, the exhibition
of artificial fire-works. They are generally formed of
thick pasteboard, made by pasting together six or eight sheets
of paper, of two inches interior diameter, three inches exterior
diameter, and fifteen inches long. They are always
placed upon a solid block or plank, and preserved in a firm
position. There is a stopper or plug made of wood, which
goes one inch into each case or pot, and is there glued and
secured by nails. This plug is turned with a screw, which
enters the plank, and preserves the pot in a steady position.
The plank, on which the pots rest, is usually three inches
wide, an inch and a half thick, and sufficiently long to receive
twelve pots, placed at the distance of half an inch apart.
Before the pots are fixed on, a hole is made through each
plug in its centre, to receive a quick match, which passes
through to the composition. A groove is also made in the
plank, in its length, one-third of an inch square; and in such
a manner, that the holes, which communicate to the interior
of the pots through the plugs, must come in the middle of
the groove. When the quick-match is put through the
plugs, to communicate with the interior of the pots, we must
leave about two inches on the outside. At each hole, also,
we put some priming paste, and then permit it to dry.</p>

<p>If it is required to discharge them all at once, this may
be done by making a communication through the groove, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
means of leaders in the manner before mentioned; and covering
the leaders with four or five bands of paper, and setting
the match or leader on fire. If, on the contrary, they are to
go off in succession, the groove is filled with bran, which is
pressed with the fingers, and is then covered with paper.
The match of communication with the pots must, however,
be preserved. The bran causes the fire to communicate
gradually from one to the other.</p>

<p>Pots are charged in the following manner: We first make
the <i>sacs of powder</i>. For this purpose, we have as many
squares of paper as there are pots, which are made into cylinders
on the same roller that formed the pots. Into each
is put about an ounce of the charge-composition, hereafter
mentioned, with two pieces of match, sufficiently long to
come out an inch. They are then closed and tied, and the
excess is cut off. One of these sacs is put into each pot,
having previously pierced it with several small holes, and
sprinkled it with meal powder. After this, the garnishing,
furniture, or decoration is added, always observing to put
the primed part downwards. A wad of paper is then put
over the whole, and the mouth is closed with pasted paper.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Composition of the charge for fire pots.</i></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl wd70">Gunpowder, in broken grains,</td><td class="tdl wd5">16</td><td class="tdl wd5">oz.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Charcoal,</td><td class="tdc">3</td><td class="tdl">&mdash;</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="p1">Fire pots are discharged in the way we have described,
which is considered the best and most certain; or they may
be fired by communicating the fire with a match, passing out
of the mouth, and hanging over the sides. Another mode
may be used, similar to that for discharging balloons or
bombs, but on a scale proportionate thereto. Pots may be
discharged in any direction; hence two pieces, or sets, may
be fired adversely, like rockets from the regulated rocket
case. Their effect depends, as we have frequently observed,
on their furniture or decorations.</p>

<p>The strength of fire pots is also to be considered. If they
are made three inches in interior diameter, it is prudent to
cover them with stout canvass, or small cord, wrapped round
and covered with a coat of glue, in the same manner as for
tourbillons.</p>

<p>Fire pots are calculated to throw serpents, &amp;c. in the air.
Mortars, it will be recollected, are designed to discharge
shells or balloons, which are thrown to a considerable height,
by the powder placed in the conical cavity; whereas fire pots,
although their contents are thrown out by blowing powder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
are differently made at the bottom, and merely designed to
project serpents, stars, &amp;c. to a small distance. Being primed,
they take fire as they pass out of the pot. The charge is
sometimes gunpowder, and, as above, composed of gunpowder
and charcoal, to lessen the power of the former. The
principle, on which they are discharged, is the same. Fire
pots are called pots of ordnance, because they are used for
discharging sundry substances, by means of gunpowder.</p>

<p class="p1">The jets of fire, which are various according to the composition
employed, may appear under several forms, sometimes
in one and sometimes in another; and hence they may
put on an asteroid appearance, or that of a fountain, or water
spout, or the form of rain. The effect, however, is very
elegant; and, in conjunction with other species of fire-works,
cannot fail to change the general appearance, by modifying
the whole, or rendering it more various.</p>

<p>These compositions are generally used in the manner
before mentioned, in cases of different sizes; but they may,
under particular circumstances, be employed otherwise. In
fact, the <i>forms</i> which may be given to the flame of gunpowder,
or the substances which compose it, either by increasing
or retarding its combustion, or changing the appearance of
the flame, and giving it the form of jets, stars, rain, &amp;c. are
so numerous, that it furnishes alone an important branch of
Pyrotechny. These effects will be detailed, when we treat of
the formation of compound works.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. II. Of Priming and Whitening Cases, and Remarks
concerning Spunk and Touch Paper.</i></p>

<p>When the cases are charged, we pierce them with a small
awl, or make a hole with a gimblet in the end, if it should
be stopped with clay, or <i>probe</i> them with a drill, as fire-workers
call it, in the hole which had been filled, in which
we put some more of the composition. This precaution is
considered necessary, in order that the earth should not cover
internally the hole of the piercer. A piece of match is
then introduced, which extends on the outside, and is secured
there with a plug of wood.</p>

<p>Brown paper, made either of linen or cotton, but not of
woollen cloth, when soaked in a concentrated solution of saltpetre,
is, we have said, rendered very combustible, and will
convey fire for small works with much facility. It is this
paper, called touch, or more properly match, paper, that is
used for capping, &amp;c. Paper of this kind may sometimes be
used, as for <i>crackers</i>, <i>serpents</i>, &amp;c. Cotton quick-match,
however, is used more generally; and, for large works, when
employed as a leader, it is usually confined in a proper tube,
the better to preserve it entire, and to keep it dry. Spunk,
made by soaking certain species of fungus in a solution of
saltpetre, takes fire very readily by the least spark, and,
therefore, is used for collecting and preserving the fire from
flint and steel. This spunk, when well made, and particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>ly
of the proper kind of fungus, may be cut into slips, and
employed advantageously in some fire-works. In all cases,
however, the object is the same, to communicate fire with
facility to the powder, or composition; and this object may
be attained by all those methods, which we have had occasion
frequently to mention. See <a href="#PYSx"><i>Pyrotechnical Sponge</i>.</a></p>

<p>To <i>whiten</i> cases is an operation, which merely consists in
covering them with paper, and is performed in the following
manner. We procure as many half-sheets of paper as we
have cases, and put them on a table one upon another. We
paste the paper, and roll each case in one of these sheets,
which is named the covering. The paper is cut in such a
manner, that it passes over the end of each case an inch and
a half. There is no particular use in this covering, the case
being made sufficiently strong without it; it makes, however,
a handsome finish. In the Chinese fire-works, their cases are
covered with different coloured papers, and frequently ornamented
with gilding. In all that I have seen, with some
of which I have made experiments, the match of communication
is nothing more than twisted match-paper. The
figures are made of paper, painted, and ornamented in the
same way; some resembling animals, &amp;c. but on a small
scale. The leaders are fixed in the usual manner, and the
works are fired in the same way. Tourbillons, serpents, and
crackers are chiefly the kind which we have seen.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="CHIx" id="CHIx"></a><i>Sec. III. Of Chinese Fire.</i></p>

<p>The composition for producing this fire, as it is peculiar,
and therefore distinct from all others, was invented by the
Chinese, and hence bears that name. The substance, which
produces the peculiar effect is cast or crude iron. See <a href="#IROx"><i>Iron</i>.</a></p>

<p>It was the brilliant light, produced when iron filings are
thrown into the fire, that gave rise to an improvement in the
fire of rockets, rendering it much more beautiful, than when
gunpowder, or the substances of which it is composed, are
alone employed. The Chinese have long been in possession of
a method of rendering fire brilliant, and variegated in its
colours. Cast-iron, reduced to a powder more or less fine, is
called iron-sand, because it answers to the name given to it
by the Chinese. They use old iron pots, which they pulverize,
till the grains are not larger than radish seed; and these
they separate into sizes or numbers, for particular purposes.</p>

<p>It should be observed, that rockets, into the composition
of which, iron-filings and iron-sand enter, cannot be long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
preserved, owing to the change which the iron undergoes in
consequence of moisture.</p>

<p>It may be proper to introduce here two tables, which exhibit
the proportions of the different ingredients for rockets
of this kind from 12 to 33 lbs.</p>

<p class="p1">These substances are incorporated together in the manner
already stated.</p>

<p>The cast-iron, we observed, is reduced to a fine powder,
or rather <i>sand</i>, as the French fire-workers call it, and is then
passed through a sieve. For the method of reducing it to
powder, consult the article on <i>Iron</i>. That the brilliancy of
the fire is owing to the iron in its crude state, without being
converted into soft or malleable iron, a process which carries
off a large quantity of carbon, oxygen, &amp;c. and increases
its specific gravity,&mdash;is very evident from the effect produced.
Wrought iron will occasion scintillations, somewhat of
the same appearance, and steel, also, in greater abundance;
and hence both are employed in sundry compositions. But
the particular character, beauty, and brilliancy of Chinese
fire must be attributed, first to the iron, and secondly to its
peculiar state of combination with carbon and oxygen; for,
we have said, that malleable iron, (which is deprived in a
great measure of these substances in the operation required
for its preparation), produces an effect far inferior to cast
iron. This difference then can only arise from the quality,
character, composition, or properties of these two kinds of
iron. Steel, on the contrary, having a more vivid effect than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
wrought iron, owes its properties to another state of combination
of the iron and carbon.</p>

<p>Hence we account for the difference in the appearance of
the flame, and consequently the effect, in the different mixtures
of crude iron, malleable iron, and steel. We have already
remarked, in treating of iron, and in explaining the
action of bodies in the process of combustion, in the section
on the theory of fire-works, that the effect of some substances
was to produce sparks, stars, &amp;c. In the present instance,
namely, the effect of the composition of the Chinese fire by
combustion, the iron is first ignited by the powerful heat created
by the combustion of the powder, nitre, charcoal, and sulphur,
and in this state, is thrown out with violence, and is itself
consumed. The combustion of iron is nothing more than
its oxidizement, during which a brilliant fire, which characterizes
so pre-eminently the Chinese fire, is produced. This
oxidizement of the metal, in proportion as it is more rapid,
necessarily gives rise to the phenomena of combustion, which,
in this, and the generality of instances, presupposes a combination
with oxygen. The fire is, therefore, more brilliant, as
the combustion is more rapid, and the metal may be oxidized
in a greater or lesser degree, but not to a maximum. From
the effect taking place in the air, as it does not ensue, or is
not seen, in the case, it follows, that the iron receives for the
support of its combustion the oxygen of the air.</p>

<p>We have said, that the substances which compose cast-iron,
are iron, carbon, and oxygen, in a peculiar state of combination.
We may also conclude, therefore, that, as carbon,
by combustion in oxygen gas, or in atmospheric air, which
contains about twenty-two per cent. produces carbonic acid,
the carbon of the iron during its combustion, is changed, by
its union with oxygen, into this acid. The products, then, are
oxide of iron, and carbonic acid, the latter existing in the
gaseous state. With respect to the other products of combustion,
arising from the gunpowder, saltpetre, sulphur, and
charcoal, we have before noticed them. See <a href="#GUNx"><i>Gunpowder</i></a>, and
the <a href="#GENx"><i>General Theory of Fire-Works</i>.</a></p>

<p>We may remark, at the same time, that the intense heat,
produced as well by the combustion of the gunpowder, as
by the combustion of charcoal and sulphur, in contact with
the nitrate of potassa, brings the metal almost to a state of
fusion; which, being thrown off in this state, and considerably
divided, is acted upon by the oxygen on all sides, causing
the effect to be uniform and general.</p>

<p>The quantity of iron, it will be seen, which enters into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
different compositions, is various, according to the particular
purpose to which the composition is applied. The <i>effect</i>,
therefore, may be varied, as we employ more or less of the
iron; and the state of ignition may be affected, as the proportions
of nitre and charcoal are increased or diminished.
These facts are obvious, by referring to the respective formulæ,
and the application of the several compositions. It is,
besides, no less true, that as much care is required in selecting
pure materials for every kind of artificial fire, as
scrupulous accuracy, in following the proportions prescribed.
Nor is this all; the mixture must be intimately made, or the
effect would be doubtful and uncertain.</p>

<p>There is a particular manner required for preparing the
composition of Chinese fire. All the substances must be passed
three times through a sieve, except the sulphur, and the
pulverized cast-iron. These are mixed by themselves, and
afterwards with the other substances. They are turned over
frequently with the hand. Cases are filled with it in the same
manner as other compositions.</p>

<p>In order to make the mixture of the sulphur with the iron
more intimate, the latter may be wetted occasionally with
spirit of wine, which should contain no water, as water would
tend to rust the metal, and injure its effect. The sulphur
would then mix with more freedom, and the composition be
more perfect. The spirit of wine, acting merely as a vehicle,
afterwards evaporates; and, as it has no chemical action on
either the sulphur or the metal, they would remain unaltered.</p>

<p>By proceeding in this manner; namely, first mixing the other
substances by themselves, and afterwards the iron and sulphur,
and then the whole, we form an intimate mixture
throughout.</p>

<p>The composition, prepared in this way, makes the fire
more brilliant; giving it a greater lustre than by proceeding
in a contrary manner.</p>

<p>We are informed, that spontaneous combustion has frequently
taken place, by suffering the iron and alcohol, or
spirit of wine, to remain in contact; and, although this appears
an anomaly, which we will not attempt to explain, yet
that it is a fact, and that it has occurred at Paris, we have
the authority of M. Morel.</p>

<p>When the cast-iron is reduced to powder, or <i>sand</i>, it is
divided into several sorts, which are proportioned to the caliber
employed. These sorts are marked or numbered, and
are used as follows: For calibers under <span class="xs"><sup>7</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>ths of an inch in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
diameter, No. 1; for those of <span class="xs"><sup>7</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>ths to <span class="xs"><sup>10</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>ths, No. 2; and for
larger calibers, No. 3.</p>

<p>In charging with the composition, care must be taken to
turn it over repeatedly at every other ladle full; because the
iron, which is the heaviest substance, is liable to fall to the
bottom. If the composition be not equally diffused, the fire
would be irregular, and go out by puffs. This is a defect
which ought to be guarded against.</p>

<p>The mixture of the composition for <i>Jessamine</i> is made in
the same manner.</p>

<p>Chinese fire, in cases, is commonly employed in garnishing,
as it is called, the circumference of a decoration, or in
forming pyramids, galleries, yew trees, cascades, palm trees,
or in short, in producing a variety of figures, according to
taste and fancy. They are often employed in turning pieces for
their last fire, in consequence of the brilliancy of their effect.</p>

<p>We are told, that nothing is more elegant than Chinese
fire; and that it forms, in its descent, flowers of variegated
beauty, which, being scattered about by the rotation of the
piece, resemble the <i>hydraulic girandole</i> in the rays of the sun.</p>

<p>Chinese fire, however, has little force; and hence, when it
is used, it is accompanied with other fire, as two or more
jets of white fire. The latter is only employed, when the
Chinese fire is to be exhibited on wheels, or turning pieces.
When it is on fixed pieces, there is no occasion for them.
Cases of Chinese fire, when burnt alone, will not turn a
wheel.</p>

<p>As the effect of Chinese fire on wheels depends greatly on
the motion of the wheel, its velocity should therefore be accelerated;
which, although the duration of its effect would
be shorter and more brilliant, may be produced by employing
several cases of white fire, and communicating their fire
one to the other by leaders in the usual manner.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, that the accelerated motion of the
wheel causes the composition to burn more rapidly, in the
same way as a bellows excites the heat of a blast-furnace;
and, therefore, the increased brilliancy of the fire may be attributed
to the greater rapidity of the combustion, which necessarily
produces, in a shorter time, the oxidizement of the
iron, and, at the same time, the combustion of the other substances.</p>

<p>With respect to the comparative force of compositions,
or that power by which cases, as rockets, &amp;c. ascend, or
which gives motion to vertical and horizontal wheels, we
may observe generally, that these effects depend on the compositions
employed; and that the <i>recoil</i>, in such instances, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
proportionate to the impelling power; for the resistance with
which the fire meets from the air, in the immediate vicinity
of the caliber of the case, causes a reaction, which produces
the recoil, and consequently the motion of the wheel. That
this effect depends, in a greater or less degree, on the composition
we use, and the manner the case is charged, is very
evident. (See <a href="#GENx"><i>General Theory of Fire-Works</i>.</a> Part 1.)</p>

<p class="p1">It may be proper to remark, that the above formulæ are
all approved; as they have been used in France, and are given
on the authority of Morel and Bigot. We are informed,
indeed, that these proportions produce the most perfect fire,
which surpasses the fire of the Chinese. From the many experiments
made in France, instituted with the view of determining
the best proportions, and leading, in fact, to the
improvement of the original composition, we do not hesitate
to give them the preference over all others.</p>

<p>In the composition of wheel-cases, Chinese fire is sometimes
used, and then only for decoration; but in nearly all
the compositions employed, in wheel-works, for standing or
fixed cases, sun-cases, &amp;c. steel-dust forms a constituent part.
The proportion it bears to other substances is various: <i>viz.</i> to
meal-powder, as one to five, one to ten, &amp;c. In one of the
formulæ for brilliant fire, the proportion is still greater, and
in another less; but by mixing seven and a half ounces of
steel-dust with meal-powder, saltpetre, and sulphur in the
proportion of eleven pounds, one pound two ounces, and four
ounces respectively, a composition is formed, calculated to
produce a brilliant fire. But as this subject will be considered,
when we treat of wheel-works, standing pieces, &amp;c. and
the different compositions appertaining thereto, we would
only observe, that Chinese fire should always be preferred,
where the object is decidedly appearance, with brilliancy
and splendour.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. IV. Of Bengal Lights.</i></p>

<p>We have had occasion to mention heretofore, that metallic
as well as the crude, or sulphuret of, antimony, entered as a
component part into some compositions, in order to vary the
effect and appearance of the flame. That this is the effect, in
the composition, which constitutes the Bengal lights, is a
fact well known, and to which its particular character is owing.</p>

<p>Bengal lights, in consequence of the whiteness and brilliancy
of their flame, are considered as highly important in fire-works.
The composition was a long time kept secret, and
artists were at a loss to compound it, for those who possessed
the secret, it appears, would not divulge it. Simple as
it is, it was not known, until many experiments were made,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
which proved its identity with the original Bengal composition;
and, since that time, it has been confirmed by the original
formula. Morel assures us, that he purchased the secret.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Composition of Bengal Lights.</i></p>

<p class="p1">They are pulverized and mixed in the usual manner, and
passed three times through a hair sieve. Any quantity may
be made at one time. The composition is usually put in earthen
vessels, without decorations. They may be of different sizes,
and, in fact, as broad as they are high, sufficiently large,
however, to contain the composition. A small quantity of dry
meal-powder is scattered over its surface, and a sheet of paper
is tied on to secure it. It is primed with port fire match.</p>

<p>The <i>effect</i> of this mixture is evidently that of the combustion
of the sulphuret of antimony, as well as of the sulphur.
The nitre furnishes the oxygen to both, and, as the combustion
is rapid, the metal is oxidized, probably forming the antimonic
acid, as the antimony may be oxidized to the maximum.
There is another view, in which this combustion may
be considered. According to the present theory of the formation
of sulphuric acid, by the combustion of sulphur, and
nitre in leaden chambers, it appears, that sulphurous acid is
first produced, and nitric oxide gas, (deutoxide of azote), is
also formed; and that the latter by uniting with the oxygen
of the air is changed into nitrous acid, which is <i>then</i> acted
upon by the sulphurous acid, and is decomposed. Part of its
oxygen combines with the sulphurous acid, changing it into
the sulphuric, and deutoxide of azote is reproduced. In all
probability, then, in the combustion of the composition of
Bengal lights, the nitric oxide itself may affect the combustion
of the antimony, which, as it would be enveloped in nitrous
acid vapour, arising from the union of nitrous gas and
oxygen, may present, in a measure, one of those cases of
combustion, in which nitric oxide acts as a supporter, affording
on that account a particular phenomenon. Reasoning
<i>a posteriori</i>, this may be affected again by the formation of
sulphuric acid; for a part of the sulphurous acid may be
changed into sulphuric, not by its immediate union with the
oxygen of the nitre, according to the old theory, but by the
decomposition of the vapour of nitrous acid. This conclusion,
however, is sufficient, that the nitre is decomposed, and dur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>ing
its decomposition, the sulphur and antimony are brought
into action; that a large quantity of caloric and light is
evolved, whether from the oxygen gas of the atmosphere, or
the substances themselves we will not stop to inquire; and,
that, in the act of combustion, the sulphur and antimony are
acidified, forming new products.</p>

<p>It will be seen, by examining the formulæ for the composition
of the white and blue-lances, that they both contain antimony,
but in different proportions: thus, in the white lance,
the proportion of antimony is as one to eight of sulphur,
as one to sixteen of saltpetre, and as one to four of meal-powder;
and in the blue-lance, as it is composed only of saltpetre
and antimony, the proportion of the latter to the former is as
eight to sixteen. In the composition of Italian roses, or fixed
stars, the proportion of antimony is still smaller, and is as one
to ten of sulphur, one to sixteen of saltpetre, and one to twelve
of meal-powder. Now, by comparing these proportions with
those which constitute the Bengal light composition, they
will be found to differ from those compositions, into which
the same substances enter; for, in the Bengal lights, the proportion
of the antimony to the sulphur is as five to nine, and
to the saltpetre, as five to thirty-two, or thereabout.</p>

<p>The inference we draw, therefore, is, that the white lance
composition differs from the blue, in containing meal-powder
and sulphur, and the latter from the former, in containing
no sulphur, but eight times as much antimony; that the
white-lance composition varies from the Bengal light, by
containing one-half less of saltpetre, one-fifth less of antimony,
and one-ninth less of sulphur; and that the Bengal
composition differs from the blue lance composition, in having
double the quantity of saltpetre, nine parts of sulphur,
(the blue-light having none,) and nearly one-third less of
antimony. If we attend to these proportions of the antimony,
with the other ingredients, in the respective preparations,
we will find, that the difference, in the proportions of the antimony,
produces, with the presence or absence of the meal-powder
and sulphur, and the difference also in the quantity
of the latter, the phenomena or effects which characterise
them. It is thus, therefore, with this, as with other preparations;
only vary the proportions, and institute new equivalents,
as it were, in any particular preparation, and adopt
some and reject other substances, and the effects are varied
agreeably thereto; and, if improvements are to be made in
any composition, they can only be effected by experiment, and
the investigation of the effects of new proportions, a compari<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>son
of which, with the effect of any particular composition,
prepared according to a given formula, can alone determine
the relative value of any new formula.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="ROMx" id="ROMx"></a><i>Sec. V. Of Roman Candles.</i></p>

<p>Roman candles are formed on a roller seven-twelfths of
an inch in diameter, and are generally fifteen inches in length.
They are choaked at one end, and tied in the usual manner.
According to the nature of the charge, which we shall mention,
their effect is to throw out brilliant stars, to the height
of one hundred and more feet, and when arranged with marrons,
they finish with a report.</p>

<p>After the cases are formed, and ready to be filled, the operation
is performed with expedition, by tying a number of
them together, and charging them in that manner. The cases
are charged with the rocket composition, heretofore described,
in the following way: A ladleful of composition is put
in, and rammed, using seven or eight blows with the mallet;
a small spoonful of powder is then added, and afterwards a
moulded star. This star should fit the caliber of the case.
More of the composition is then added, then meal-powder,
and afterwards a star, and these are repeated in the same order,
till the case is completely charged. Care must be taken
in observing this order, otherwise the effect would be destroyed.
In striking with the mallet, attention must also be
paid, that the blows are not too violent, or the star might be
destroyed. When the cases, or candles, are charged, we
untie them, and roll some coarse paper round each end of
them, at the extremity, and round the choak.</p>

<p>We may remark, that in the charging of Roman candles,
as their effect depends greatly on the appearance of the stars,
which issue out in succession, too much care cannot be used
in preserving the star composition entire. To do this, much
art is required in putting in, and ramming, the rocket composition,
so as not to injure or break it. The quantity of
gunpowder to each star must be small, otherwise it might
burst the case. Roman candles may be fired singly or several
at a time, according to the effect required. To fire one
in a chandelier, for instance, it is only necessary to prime it
with priming paste; but, if we wish to form batteries in an
artificial fire-work, in order to produce a variety, or to mount
them on fixed or moveable pieces, we may, if necessary,
terminate their effect with marrons, which may be effected
by uniting them in such a way as to make the fire of the one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
at a given time, communicate to the other. This communication
is usually made through the choak, by attaching a
match, which is carried to the mouth of the marron; so that,
when the candle has burnt out, the last portion of the fire
may pass to the marron, the effect of which is instantaneous.
If necessary, priming paste may be used to facilitate the
communication of the fire. The marron may be fixed directly
under the bottom of the candle, by making the whole
solid by a paper cylinder, which fits over the ends of both.</p>

<p>The mosaic candles, as well as mosaic simples, are formed
in cases of the same thickness as sky-rockets, from which
they differ in the introduction of stars along with the composition.
We may remark, also, that they are rolled without
pasting; and although Morel recommends choaking the cases,
yet a writer of more recent date, M. Bigot, whose practical
knowledge must be great, recommends <i>plugging</i> them
on the stick or roller. This is done by merely turning the
end down about half an inch, and then beating it. Before
the composition is added, he advises, also, the introduction
of two or three fingers' thickness of clay, which is rammed
very solid. This answers for a base, and supersedes the
necessity of choaking. If, as we before remarked, it is necessary
to communicate fire from this end to a marron or
any other case, the clay must be bored to the composition,
and quickmatch inserted; or, instead of this, the case itself,
above the clay, may be perforated, and a communication in
this way made.</p>

<p>Besides the ordinary Roman candles, intended expressly
for exhibition, there is another preparation, which goes under
the name of the incendiary Roman candle, used for the purposes
of war. This preparation is composed of three parts
of sulphur, four parts of saltpetre, one part of antimony,
and half a part of meal-powder; but this, together with the
incendiary stars, we purpose to consider when we treat of
<i>Military Fire-works</i>.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VI. Of Mosaic Simples.</i></p>

<p>Mosaic simples are in reality nothing more than a variety
of the Roman candle, being formed in the same manner, and
of the same composition, except that the moulded stars are
different, and produce another effect. The mosaic simples
produce merely a tail, or spout of fire; whereas the Roman
candle throws out a brilliant star. They may be used with
marrons in the same manner as the Roman candle. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
length of the case is fifteen inches, and seven-twelfths of an
inch in diameter. Mosaic simples are very appropriate to
terminate a piece. A number of cases may be used by
placing them in such a manner, that their fires may cross each
other, an effect more striking than the ordinary mode of exhibition.
This may be accomplished by arranging them, two
and two, to a horizontal stick, observing that their mouths
are up, and that they cross each other. They are lashed to
the stick, and leaders are carried from the mouth of one to
the mouth of another. This communication is so managed,
that two pieces discharge at the same time. They may be
employed in a variety of ways, according to fancy.</p>

<p>Sometimes <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'pyrimids'">pyramids</ins> forty or fifty feet high are furnished
on each side, with cases of mosaic simples, with a star at
the summit, and white and coloured lances differently dispersed.</p>

<p>The curtain of fire, produced by so many cases, the height
to which it rises, the appearance of the star with the variegated
and diversified effect of the coloured lances, all contribute
to the splendour of this arrangement.</p>

<p class="centerx"><a name="FIRy" id="FIRy"></a><i>Sec. VIII. Of Hydrogen Gas in Fire-Works.</i></p>

<p>M. Diller, some years since, exhibited at the pantheon of
Paris, artificial fire produced by the combustion of hydrogen
gas. From the short account we have of this exhibition
in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire de l'Industrie</cite>, vol. iii, p. 39, it seems,
that he employed three different <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'air'">airs</ins>, or gases, and produced
three different flames: viz. white, blue, and green, which
were made by the mixture of the three gases; and that he
represented very perfectly, suns, stars, triangles, the cross of
Malta, and sundry figures of animals in motion.</p>

<p>We may remark, that, if hydrogen gas be pure, the flame
is of a yellowish-white; but this, however, is seldom the
case, as the gas is always more or less impure, and, according
to the substances it may hold in solution, so is the flame
tinged. It is most usually reddish, because the gas holds in
solution a little charcoal. In Cartwright's fire, ether is always
mixed with the whole, or a <i>part</i> of the gas, which is
brought to the state of vapour by the application of a gentle
heat, or even by immersing the bladder of gas, which contains
the liquid ether, in hot water.</p>

<p>When combined with arsenic, in the form of arsenuretted
hydrogen gas, hydrogen burns with a blue flame; combined
with phosphorus it takes fire spontaneously, producing a
white flame with a beautiful corona, caused by the formation
of water; and when combined with sulphur, forming sulphuretted
hydrogen or hepatic gas, it burns with a bluish-red
flame, and a quantity of sulphur is deposited. Various mixtures
of hydrogen with other gases, in due proportions, will
produce different coloured flames; so that, by paying attention
to this circumstance, the same variety of appearances
may be produced, as in Diller's exhibition.</p>

<p>Bladders, (or sacks made of oiled silk, which are preferable),
when filled with gas, and connected with tubes, revolving
jets, &amp;c. bent in different directions, and formed into various
figures, and pierced with holes of different sizes, will,
when pressure is applied, allow the gas to pass through the
different tubes, jets, &amp;c. which, when inflamed, will represent
the sun and stars. If to this be added, triangular tubes, tubes
in the form of the cross of Malta, or any other figure, they
being pierced in their sides with a great number of holes not
larger than the point of a pin; it is obvious, that fixed pieces
may be represented, as well as revolving ones. In this manner,
Diller must have made his exhibition.</p>

<p>Hydrogen gas is usually made, by pouring on zinc, or iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
filings, in a gas bottle, sulphuric acid diluted with six times
its weight of water. The latter is decomposed; its oxygen
unites with the metal, and while the oxide is taken up by the
acid, the hydrogen passes off in the form of gas. The gas
may be received directly in the bladder or bag.</p>

<p>The <i>inflammable air pistol</i> is nothing more than a hollow
metallic cylinder, or an instrument in the shape of two cones
joined base to base, and furnished with a touch-hole, and
handle. This pistol is filled with a mixture of hydrogen and
oxygen gases, or in lieu of the latter, atmospheric air; a plug
or stopper is put in the caliber, and, when the touch-hole
is brought in contact with a lighted taper, an explosion will
take place, and the plug be sent out with much force. The
same effect may be shown by passing the electric spark over
the touch-hole, and hence, on an insulated stool, a person,
charged with electricity, may set it off by the finger or nose.
This pistol is usually called the Voltaic pistol, from Volta,
who is said to have invented it.</p>

<p>M. Biot (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de Physique Experimentale</cite>, &amp;c. tome ii,
p. 435) describes the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Votaic'">Voltaic</ins> pistol as a metallic vessel of a
spheroid shape, furnished with an aperture and pipe, and with
a conductor for the electric fluid, which passes through the
middle of the vessel. This conductor is insulated, as it goes
through a glass tube, and extends to within an eighth of an
inch of the middle; and directly opposite to this conductor
is a metallic wire, having, like the first conductor, a small
metallic ball on its end. This conductor is placed a short distance
from the first; so that, when the electric fluid is conducted,
it passes from one ball to the other within the pistol,
and hence inflames the hydrogen gas. With respect to the
form of the pistol, it is of no moment whether it be cylindrical,
conical, or globular, as the effect is the same, provided
that it contain a sufficient quantity of gas, and the spark
is conveyed through the gas, or the gas is inflamed by a vent.
The air pistol described by Brande (<cite>Brande's Chemistry</cite>) is
cylindrical, or rather in the shape of a cannon, and, where
the touch-hole should be, there is an insulated conductor,
which conveys the spark to the interior.</p>

<p>The <i>Voltaic lamp</i> is also a contrivance by which hydrogen
gas is inflamed by the electric spark, which sets fire to a taper.
The original lamp has been greatly improved, and simplified.
The eudiometer of Volta is another contrivance by
which hydrogen gas is burnt, in a strong tube, by the electric
spark.</p>

<p>The detonation of inflammable air may be shown over a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
pneumatic tub, by filling metallic gas-holders with a mixture
of hydrogen gas and atmospheric air. When flame is brought
in contact with the mouth of the gas-holder, an explosion
will immediately take place. Soap-bubbles, blown with hydrogen
gas, mixed with atmospheric air, will take fire, on
presenting a lighted taper, and give a slight explosion. The
ascension of these bubbles demonstrates, that the gas is lighter
than atmospheric air, and it is its extreme levity that fits
it for the purpose of filling balloons. It may be made twelve
times specifically lighter than atmospheric air, by passing it
over dry muriate of lime, in order to absorb the moisture it
may contain, provided the gas be free from carbon, or carbonic
acid.</p>

<p>Light carburetted hydrogen gas, or <i>fire-damp</i> of miners,
is that gas, which so often formerly produced many dreadful
accidents by its explosion. The invention, by Sir H. Davy,
of the safety-lamp prevents this effect.</p>

<p>The principle of this most valuable discovery, appears to
be altogether in the fine metallic gauze case, which surrounds
the flame of the lamp; so that, as it is found by numerous
and repeated experiments, the inflammable air, if present,
cannot take fire outside of the gauze; in other words, the
flame, in the interior of the case, is prevented from setting
fire to the exterior atmosphere, however explosive it may be.</p>

<p>Hydrogen gas, in combination with carbon, is not only generated
in mines and coal pits, (in the latter of which, it is
the most abundant), but is frequently found on the surface of
springs in the form of bubbles, usually however combined
with sulphur; and in many places on the surface of the earth.
It may be inflamed by a candle. The burning springs consist
of this gas which is set on fire, and the combustion is kept
up by a constant supply of gas from the same source. In the
East, this gas is very often conveyed under ground through
hollow reeds, and is constantly kept burning. At other times,
it is conveyed to the sacred temples, as with the Zoroasters,
and burnt as <i>holy fire</i>; and in some countries, it is so abundant,
that the natives employ it as fuel for boiling their pots.
It is found in different parts of the United States. A
striking incident, showing its effects, occurred lately near
Cincinnati, in the state of Ohio. It appears, that, in making
an excavation, and boring for salt water, the workmen penetrated
their augur into a cavity, which contained an abundance
of gas, and which, with the water, made its way to the
excavation. Not suspecting that the gas was inflammable, or
being unacquainted with it, and apprehending no danger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
they brought a lighted taper; and the gas, being mixed with
atmospheric air, exploded with a noise so considerable, that
it was heard several miles in the neighbourhood. The men
were much burnt, some of them dangerously.</p>

<p>The gas was afterwards inflamed by applying a taper, as
it rose in bubbles from the surface of the water.</p>

<p>The philosophical candle is nothing more than hydrogen
gas set on fire as it proceeds from a capillary tube, being
formed in a bottle to which the tube is attached. The most
brilliant flame, however, is produced by hydroguret of carbon,
or olefiant gas.</p>

<p>Inflammable air is often generated in the stomachs of dead
persons, for, on applying a lighted candle, the <i>vapour</i> has
been known to take fire. Dr. Swediaur relates some instances
of the same kind, but in living persons, in which the <i>urine</i>
of the by standers was made use of. According to several
authorities, combustion has been known to take place spontaneously
in living persons. Lair, however, is of opinion,
that, in these cases, it must have occurred by some slight
external cause, such as the fire of a candle, taper, or pipe.
There can be no question as to the developement of hydrogen
gas.</p>

<p>Morse, (<cite>Universal Geography</cite>, article Persia, p. 588), after
mentioning the Persian <i>guebres</i>, the disciples and successors
of the ancient magi, and followers of Zoroaster, speaks
of a combustible ground about ten miles distant from Baku,
a city in the north of Persia, as the place for their devotion.
This ground contains several old temples, and is remarkable
for the quantity of inflammable air it emits, which is employed
to produce the <i>sacred flame of universal fire</i>. If the
ground be penetrated with a stick, there will issue out such
a prodigious quantity of inflammable air, as, when lighted,
will burn for a considerable time. This gas, we remarked, is
employed there for lighting, cooking, and other purposes.
The naphtha districts, in Persia, furnish this gas in abundance.
See <a href="#NAPx"><i>Naphtha</i>.</a></p>

<p>A Sandusky (Ohio) paper states, that, about one mile and
a quarter from Milan, is a place just in the edge of the water
of Huron river, where there is a current of inflammable gas,
that burns with a clear bright blaze, and is in sufficient quantity
to light ten houses.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a><a href="#TOC_PART_3">CHAPTER X.</a></h3>

<p class="negidt1">OF THE MANNER OF FIXING AND ARRANGING
FIRE-WORKS IN GENERAL FOR EXHIBITION.</p>


<p>Having already treated of the formation of various kinds
of fire-works, we come now to consider their arrangement in
fixed and moveable pieces.</p>

<p>It is obvious, that the order of arrangement, the manner
of disposing the work, or establishing pieces for exhibition,
may be greatly varied according to taste and fancy. The
great variety of fixed and moveable pieces, consisting of suns,
moons, stars, &amp;c. which may be either made permanent, or
to revolve on, or round a centre; or of wheels, double, single,
or treble, either moving round other wheels, or by themselves
in a vertical or horizontal order, together with the arrangement
of fire-pots, and coloured lights, the management
of rockets, the formation of aerial stars, serpents, tourbillons,
&amp;c. and the imitation of cascades, girandoles, and water-falls,
all depend on the taste and fancy of the artist.</p>

<p>It is our intention, therefore, in the different sections of this
chapter, to give the order and arrangement of pieces, as adopted
in Europe, and particularly in France; so that the manner
of fixing any one piece, or combination of pieces, to produce
effects of different kinds, may be seen at one view. The
moveable pieces are generally made of wheel-work, the wheel
always turning upon an axle, which may pass entirely through
and be kept on by a nut or pin. They should revolve without
much friction, and, for this reason, the spindle should be of
metal, and oiled or greased. Black lead, along with tallow,
will diminish the friction very considerably. As to the formation
of the wheel, whether it be solid, or formed of spokes
and a band or hoop, or made with several concentric bands,
placed at given distances apart, &amp;c. the observations on this
head will be found under the respective articles, and, generally,
on all other pieces for exhibition.</p>

<p>We purpose, in a subsequent chapter, to notice particularly
the works, made in and on water, usually denominated
<i>aquatic fire-works</i>; as their arrangement, in many respects,
differs from those on the land. Aquatic works furnish a variety,
both in character and effect, and, therefore, are calculated
to produce, in conjunction with land works, a brilliant
spectacle. Of this, we have an instance, mentioned in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>introduction
to this part of our work, in the splendid exhibition
at the <i>Pont Neuf</i> in Paris.</p>

<p>It may not be improper, before noticing the arrangement
of wheel-cases, to give in this place the compositions, which
are used for charging them, reserving, however, the notice
of some preparations, when we treat of such works, in which
they are particularly employed.</p>

<p class="p1">This view of the compositions used in fixed and turning
pieces, exhibits the various compounds which <i>have been</i> employed,
and, therefore, may be relied upon. Notwithstanding
they are considered the standard formulæ; yet we must observe,
that in some, particularly in the turning sun, with variations,
changes are required, in order to produce a variety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
in the effect. This is accomplished, by making, in the first
place, a particular composition, and mixing a given quantity
of it with meal-powder, which forms the second change. Of
this second composition, combined in a given proportion,
with meal-powder, we form a third change; and, in like manner,
we employ the third along with more powder, to form
a fourth, and the fourth to form a fifth. The particular
manner of making these changes will be described in a future
section.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. II. Of Single, Vertical, Horizontal, Spiral, and other
wheels.</i></p>

<p>Of the different kinds of <i>vertical wheels</i>, we may mention,
that some have their fells of a circular form, others, in
the form of a hexagon, octagon, or of a figure of a greater
number of sides, according to the length of the cases designed
for the wheels. The spokes being fixed in the nave,
nail slips of tin, with their edges turned up, so as to form
grooves for the cases to lie in, from the end of one spoke to
another. Then tie the cases in the grooves head to tail, in the
same manner as those on the horizontal water-wheel; so that
the cases successively taking fire from one to another, will
keep the wheel in an equal rotation. Two of these wheels
are very often fired together, one on each side of a building,
and both lighted at the same time, and all the cases filled alike
to make them keep time together. This may be accomplished
in the following manner. In all the cases of both wheels,
except the first, and on each wheel, drive two or three ladles
full of slow fire, in any part of the cases, but be careful
to ram the same quantity in each case; and in the end of
one of the cases on each wheel, one ladle full of dead-fire
composition, which must be very lightly driven. Many charges
of fire may be made by the same method.</p>

<p>The hole in the nave of the wheel may be lined with brass,
and made to turn on a smooth iron spindle. On the end of
this spindle, let there be a nut to screw off and on. When we
have placed the wheel on the spindle, screw on the nut,
which will keep the wheel from flying off. Let the mouth of
the first case be a little raised.</p>

<p>Vertical wheels are made from ten inches, to three feet in
diameter, and the size of the cases must vary accordingly.
Four-ounce cases will be sufficient for wheels of fourteen or
sixteen inches in diameter, which is the proportion generally
used. The best wood for wheels of all kinds, is the light
and dry beech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Horizontal wheels</i> are more perfect, when their fells are
made circular. In the middle of the top of the nave must
be a pintle, turned out of the same piece as the nave, two
inches long, and equal in diameter to the bore of one of
the cases of the wheel. There must be a hole bored up the
centre of the nave, within half an inch of the top of the pintle.
Nail at the end of each spoke, of which there should
be six or eight, a piece of wood with a groove, cut in it to
receive the case. Fix these pieces in such a manner, that half
the cases may incline upwards, and half downwards, and
that, when they are tied on, their heads and tails, or extremities,
may come very near together. From the tail of one
case to the mouth of the other, carry a leader, which is necessary
to be secured with pasted paper. Besides these
pipes, a little meal-powder must be placed in the inside of
the pasted paper, to blow off the pipe, that there may be no
obstruction to the fire from the cases. By means of these
pipes, the cases will successively take fire, burning one upwards,
and the other downwards. On the pintle, fix a case
of the same sort as those on the wheel. This case must be
fired by a leader from the mouth of the last case on the
wheel, which case must play downwards. Instead of a common
case in the middle, we may put a case of Chinese fire,
sufficiently long to burn a given time, or as long as two or
three cases on the wheel.</p>

<p>Horizontal wheels are often fired two at a time, and made
to keep time, like vertical wheels, only they are prepared
without any slow or dead-fire. Ten or twelve inches will be
sufficient for the diameter of wheels with six spokes.</p>

<p>With respect to <i>spiral wheels</i>, we may remark, that they
are only double horizontal wheels, made in the following
manner: The nave must be thicker than that of the single
sort; and, instead of the pintle at top, a hole is usually made
for the case to be fixed in. There are two sets of spokes,
one set put near the top of the nave, and the other, near the
bottom. At the end of each spoke, cut a groove, in which
the cases are to be tied, there being no fell. The spokes
should not be more than three and a half inches long from
the nave, so that the wheel may not be more than eight or
nine inches in diameter. The cases are placed in such a
manner, that those at top play down, and those at the bottom
play up; but let the third or fourth case burn horizontally.
The case in the middle may begin with any of the others.
Six spokes will be sufficient for each set; so that the wheel may
consist of twelve cases, besides that on the top; the cases six
inches each.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Plural wheels</i> are different from the former. They are made
to turn horizontally, and consist of three sets of spokes,
placed six at top, six at bottom, and four in the middle,
which must be a little shorter than the rest. Let the diameter
of the wheel be ten inches. The cases must be tied on
the ends of the spokes, in grooves, cut on purpose, or in pieces
of wood, nailed on the ends of the spokes, with grooves
cut in them as usual. In clothing these wheels, make the
upper set of cases play obliquely downwards, the bottom set
obliquely upwards, and the middle set, horizontally. In placing
the leaders, we must so arrange them, as that the case
may turn thus: namely, first up, then down, then horizontally,
and so on with the rest. But another change may be made,
by driving in the end of the eighth case two or three ladles full
of slow fire, to burn till the wheel has stopt its course. Then
let the other cases be fixed the contrary way, which will make
the wheel run back again. For the case at top, we may put
a small gerbe, and the cases on the spokes may be short, and
filled with the strong brilliant charge.</p>

<p>For forming the <i>illuminated spiral wheel</i>, we must proceed
thus: First have a circular horizontal wheel, made two
feet in diameter, with a hole quite through the nave; then
take three thin pieces of light board, three feet long each,
and three-fourths of an inch broad. One end of each of
these pieces, nail to the fell of the wheel, at an equal distance
from one another; and the other end, nail to a block with a
hole in its bottom, which must be perpendicular to that in the
block of the wheel, but not so large. Plane a hoop down very
thin and flat, and nail one end of it to the end of the wheel,
and wind it round three sticks in a spiral line, from the wheel
to the block at top. On the top of this block, fix a case of Chinese
fire. On the wheel may be placed any number of cases,
which must incline downwards, and burn two at a time. If
the wheel should consist of ten cases, we may let the illuminations
and Chinese fire begin with the second cases. The
spindle for this wheel must be a little longer than the cone,
and made very smooth at top, on which the upper block is to
turn, and the whole weight of the wheel to rest.</p>

<p>For making the <i>double spiral wheel</i>, the block, or nave,
must be as long as the height of the worms, or spiral lines;
but must be very thin, and as light as possible. In this
block fix several spokes, which must diminish in length from
the wheel to the top, so as not to exceed the surface of a cone
of the same height. To the ends of these spokes nail the
worms, which must cross each other, several times. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
worms clothe with the same illuminations as those on the
single wheels, but the horizontal wheel may be clothed according
to fancy. At the top of the worm, place a case of
slow fire, or an amber light.</p>

<p><i>Balloon wheels</i> turn horizontally. They are usually made
two feet in diameter without any spokes, and very strong,
with any number of sides. On the top of the wheel, range and
fix in pots of three inches in diameter, and seven inches high
each, as many as there are cases on the wheel. Near the
bottom of each pot, make a small vent; and into each of these
vents, carry a leader from the tail of each case. Some of
the pots may be charged with stars and some with serpents,
crackers, &amp;c. As the wheels turn, the pots will be fired in
succession, and throw into the air a great variety of fires.</p>

<p><i>Fruiloni wheels</i> are made with a nave, nine inches long,
and three inches in diameter.  Near the bottom of this
nave, fix eight spokes with a hole in the end of each, sufficiently
large to receive a two or four-ounce case. Each of
these spokes may be fourteen inches long from the block.
Near the top of this block, fix three more of the same spokes,
exactly over the others, but not so long by two inches. As
this wheel is to run horizontally, all the cases in the spokes,
must play obliquely upwards, and all those in the spokes at
bottom, obliquely downwards. This being accomplished,
have a small horizontal wheel, made with eight spokes, each
five inches long from the block. On the top of this wheel,
place a case of brilliant fire. All the cases on this wheel must
play in an oblique direction downwards, and burn two at a
time; and those on the large wheel, four at a time; i. e.
two of those on the top set of spokes, and two of those in the
bottom set of spokes.</p>

<p>The four first cases on the large wheel, and the two first
on the small, must be fired at the same time, and the brilliant
fire at the top, at the beginning of the last cases. The cases
of the wheels may be filled with a gray charge. When these
wheels are completed, we must have a strong iron spindle,
four feet six inches long; and fixed perpendicularly on the
top of a stand. On this, we put the large wheel, whose nave
must have a hole quite through from the bottom to the top.
This hole must be large enough to turn easy round the bottom
of the spindle, at which place there must be a shoulder,
to keep the wheel from touching the stand. At the top of
the spindle, put the small wheel, and join it to a large one
with a leader, in order that they may be fired both together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pin wheels</i>, as they are called, are formed by rolling some
paper into pipes of about fourteen inches in length. The paper
should be thin, and rolled of three thicknesses. When
they are thoroughly dried, procure a tin tube, twelve inches
long, to fit easy into the pipes. At one end of this tube, fix
a small conical cup, which cone is called a funnel; then bend
one end of one of the pipes, and put the funnel in at the
other, as far as it will reach, and fill the cup with composition.
Draw out the funnel gently, shaking it up and down,
and it will fill the pipe, as it comes out. Having filled some
pipes, procure some small blocks, about one inch in diameter
and half an inch thick. Round one of these blocks, wind
and paste a pipe, and to the end of this pipe, join another,
which must be done by twisting the end of one pipe to a
point, and putting it into the end of the other with a little
paste. In this manner, join four or five pipes, winding them
one upon another, so as to form a spiral line. Having wound
on the pipes, paste two strips of paper across them to hold
them together. The pipes must also be pasted together.</p>

<p>The other method of making these wheels is described
thus: wind on the pipes without paste, and stick them together
with sealing wax at every half turn; so that, when they
are fired, the end will fall loose, every time the fire passes
the wax, by which means the circle of fire will be considerably
increased.</p>

<p>The formers for these pipes are made from 1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> to <span class="xs"><sup>4</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span>ths
of an inch in diameter. They may be fired on a large pin,
and held in the hand with safety.</p>

<p class="centerx"><a name="SUNx" id="SUNx"></a><i>Sec. III. Of Revolving Suns.</i></p>

<p>From what has been said in the preceding section, it is
obvious, that revolving or turning suns may be formed, or
any piece put in motion, in the manner already described.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
The most common mode of forming a sun, is to attach to
three naves, which proceed from a hub, that revolves on a
spindle, from three to six cases, placing them in such a way,
that they may be fired successively. The jets, or spouts, proceeding
from the cases, constitute the <i>rays</i>, the sun being in
the centre, which revolves with the cases on an axis. The
arrangement of these cases should be such, as that the six
(as that number is usually employed,) might form the perimeter.</p>

<p>The cases may be charged with one, or with different
compositions, given in the following table. They are attached
in such a way, that the head of the first is nearly in
contact with the <i>ray</i> of the second, and that to the third, &amp;c.
When the first case is finishing, it must, therefore, communicate
fire to the second, that to the third, and so on in succession.
These cases must be attached firmly by wire; and leaders
are used to communicate the fire, as in other works. The
end must be enclosed in the neck of the first case, and the
other end in that of the second, &amp;c. They are secured in
their respective positions, by tying them securely to the
cases.</p>

<p>With respect to the composition employed, it may be varied
according to pleasure. In most instances, however, the
ordinary sun-composition is used; but, in other instances, this
is varied according to circumstances. Morel has adopted
the following composition for a sun of six cases, the cases
being eight-twelfths of an inch in diameter. These cases are
mounted on the arms of the sun in the same manner as before
described.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Composition for a sun with variations, the cases of which are

</table>

<p class="p1">It appears evident, that the changes thus produced are owing
to the diminution of the quantity of saltpetre and sulphur,
or, in other words, to the increase of the quantity of
powder; and that the fourth change must contain but a small
quantity of each, whilst the sixth or last change contains
none, except that which is in the composition of the powder.
The effect, therefore, must be proportionate; for, it
must be apparent, that this diminution of nitre and sulphur,
and the increase of powder, must render each charge more
explosive, or, in other words, the combustion more instantaneous,
and that this effect characterizes each of the changes
in succession, is a result which necessarily follows.</p>

<p>The instructions given by Morel for employing these
changes, in the charging of cases, are thus: We take the
above composition for the third case of the sun. The first
case is of common fire; the second of silver rain; the third of
two charges of common fire, and afterwards a charge of No.
1, the second two charges of No. 2, the third three charges
of No. 3, the fourth four charges of No. 4, the fifth four
charges of No. 5, and two charges of No. 6. The fourth
case is composed of brilliant fire; the fifth the same as the
third, and the sixth of large or grand jessamine.</p>

<p>We may merely remark, that the sun must be supported
very firmly, and that it ceases to revolve at the fourth, fifth,
and sixth numbers.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. IV. Of Fixed Suns.</i></p>

<p>Fixed suns are so called, because they remain stationary,
and exhibit the appearance of a sun with innumerable rays.
A fixed sun is formed by putting eight or more strips of
board across each other, so that each arm may proceed from
a common centre, in which a sun is painted on silk. To the
extremities of these arms are attached, to each one in succes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>sion,
a case of brilliant fire, which, by means of bodies fixed
in the usual manner, go off together. The two arms below,
forming right angles with each other, are longer than the
rest; so is also the upper and vertical arm. This, however,
depends upon fancy. The cases are tied to these arms; and,
after the leaders are fixed from the mouth of one case to that
of the other, they terminate at the bottom and hang below
the vertical arm. Fire is first communicated to the hanging
match.</p>

<p>Fixed suns are usually employed as a decoration for other
works. They are sometimes sixty feet in diameter, and
variously decorated. They are commonly, however, ten
feet. The fire extends a considerable distance, sometimes,
it is said, to the distance of thirty feet; but this must depend
on the size of the cases.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. V. Of Fixed Suns with Transparent Faces.</i></p>

<p>Fixed suns may be made with transparent faces in the
following manner: Two rows of cases must be fixed in radii
from the face of the sun, the sun being in the centre; and
these cases, being placed alternately one above the other, and
preserving the same distance all round, present what is called
a double glory, and make the rays strong and full. The
frame or sun-wheel is made thus: Have a circular flat nave,
made very strong, 12 inches in diameter, and fix six strong
flat spokes, proceeding from the circle that contains the sun's
face to the extremity of the wheel, and also two other hoops,
placed between it and the sun. To these, and the external
wheel, the cases are tied. When the cases are tied on,
leaders are attached from the upper to the under cases. The
front of these spokes supports a circular fell, five feet in diameter.
Within this is another fell, smaller in diameter by
the length of one of the sun cases; and within this also is a
third fell, whose diameter must be less than the second by
the length of one case and one third. The fells are divided
into as many equal parts as we employ cases, which may be
from twenty-four to forty-four. At each division, fix a flat
iron staple. These staples must be made to fix the cases
and hold them fast on the wheel. The staples must be so
placed, that one row of cases may lie in the middle of the
intervals of the other. There is a spindle in the centre of
the block of the sun, to which a small hexagonal wheel is
put. The cases of this wheel must be filled with the same
charge as the cases of the sun. Two cases must burn at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
time, and begin with them on the fells. The pipes of communication
are to be carried from one to the other, and from
one side of the sun to the wheel in the middle, and from
thence to the other side of the sun. They will hold the
wheel steady, when the sun is fixing up.</p>

<p>A sun thus made is called a brilliant sun, as there appears
nothing but sparks of brilliant fire, the wood-work being covered
with fire from the wheel in the middle. A transparent
face is usually made with pasteboard, by cutting out
the eyes, nose, and mouth, for the sparks of the wheel to
appear through. A face may be painted on oiled paper,
or Persian silk, put over a hoop, and supported by three or
four pieces of wire at six inches distance from the wheel in
the centre. The silk may be painted according to fancy.</p>

<p>As to the size of cases for a sun of five feet in diameter,
half-pound cases, filled ten inches with composition, is considered
a good proportion.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VI. Of the Rose-Piece and Sun.</i></p>

<p>This exhibition may be made in such a manner as to produce
a pleasing effect. A rose-piece may be used for a
mutation, or change of a regulated piece, or fixed by itself.
It makes the best appearance, when made large. If its exterior
diameter be six feet, it will be a good size. Let the
exterior fell be made of wood, and supported by four wooden
spokes. All the other parts, on which the illuminations are
fixed, must be made of strong iron-wire. On the exterior
fell, place as many half pound cases of brilliant charge, as
will be sufficient; but the more, the greater will be the effect,
for the nearer the cases are placed, the stronger will be the
rays of the sun. The illuminations should be placed within
three inches of each other. They must all be fired together,
and burn some time before the sun is lighted, which may be
done by carrying a leader from the middle of one of the
illuminations to the mouth of one of the sun cases.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VII. Of the Manner of changing a Horizontal to a
Vertical Wheel, and representing a Sun in front.</i></p>

<p>In order to produce this change, the wheel for this purpose
should be about three feet in diameter, and its fell circular,
on which tie sixteen half-pound cases, filled with brilliant
charge. Two of these cases must burn at a time. On each
end of the nave is to be a tin barrel of the same construc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>tion
as those on the regulated piece. We must then have a
stand, made of any height, about three or four inches square,
and saw off from the top a piece two feet long. This piece
is then to be joined again, at the place where it was cut,
with a hinge on one side, so that it may lift up and down in
the front of the stand. Then fix on the top of the bottom
part of the stand, on each side, a bracket, which must project,
at right angles with the stand, one foot from the front,
for the short piece to rest on. These brackets are to be
placed a little above the joint of the post, so that, when the
upper stand falls, it may lie between them at right angles
with the bottom stand; which may be done by fixing a piece
of wood one foot long between the brackets, and even with
the top of the bottom stand. Then, as the brackets rise
above the bottom stand, they will form a channel for the
short post to lie in, and keep it steady without straining the
hinge. On the side of the short post, opposite the hinge,
nail a piece of wood of such a length, that, when the post is
perpendicular, it may reach about one and a half feet down
the long post; to which, being tied, it will hold the short
stand upright. The stand being thus prepared, in the top of
it, fix a spindle ten inches long. On this spindle put the
wheel; then fix on a brilliant sun, with a <i>single glory</i>. The
diameter of this sun must be six inches less than that of the
wheel. When we fire this piece, attention must be paid to
light the wheel first, and let it run horizontally till four
cases are consumed. Then, from the end of the fourth case,
carry a leader into the tin barrel that turns over the end of
the stand. This leader must be met by another, brought
through the top of the post, from a case filled with a strong
port-fire charge, and tied to the bottom post, with its mouth
facing the pack thread, which holds up the stand; so that,
when this case is lighted it will burn the pack thread and let
the wheel fall forward, by which means it will become vertical.
Then from the last case of the wheel, carry a leader
into the barrel, next the sun, which will begin as soon as the
wheel is burnt out.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VIII. Of Caprices and Fire-Wands.</i></p>

<p>Caprices are so called from the particular motion they assume,
and are regulated according to the order and manner
of their firing.</p>

<p>A perpendicular shaft, or post, is first provided, in which
are placed two sets of spokes at some distance from each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
other. At the extremities of these spokes, joints are made,
on which the cases are fixed. These cases communicate
with each other by leaders. The first which takes fire, discharges
upwards; the second, vertically; the third, horizontally;
and the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh, go off at the
same time; <i>viz.</i> the fourth, upwards; the fifth, vertically, a
little inclined; the sixth, horizontally; and the seventh, vertically.
The match of communication is fixed by a port-fire.</p>

<p>The arrangement of this piece, to produce the effect, depends
on the construction of the wood work.</p>

<p>The great falling caprice differs from the foregoing in the
following particular, that it separates itself in the midst of its
fire into three parts. It is formed of three wheels, which
appear as one; but at a certain time after the fire is communicated,
they separate and occupy certain positions.</p>

<p>Mercury's Wand, as it is called, is formed by placing,
across each other, two pieces of wood, and at the extremity
of each four lances parallel to each other, and one obliquely.
These lances of illumination must be connected by leaders.
Circular bands are attached to the extremity of each leg,
which terminates in the centre, and the wings or legs move
in opposite directions. The double crescents, thus formed,
produce, in turning, a variety of figures.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. IX. Of Palm and other Trees.</i></p>

<p>The representation of trees is considered an elegant fire-work.
Palm trees are shown by fixing an upright piece,
which serves as a trunk, and attaching to it a number of
pieces, resembling in effect the branches of a tree. The extremities
or branches are decorated with gerbes, and sometimes
with marrons, arranged in such a manner that they
may go off together.</p>

<p>For Yew trees, cases of brilliant fire, jessamine, or Chinese
are used. In making this representation, the upright piece
is usually four feet in length, two inches in breadth, and one
inch thick. At the top we fix, on the flat side, a hoop fourteen
inches in diameter, and round its edge and front, place
illuminations, and in its centre a five-pointed star. At a
foot and a half from the edge of the hoop, two cases of brilliant
fire are usually placed, one on each side. These cases
should be one foot long each. Below these are usually fixed
two more cases, at such a distance that their mouths may almost
meet those at top. Two other cases are sometimes ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>ded,
which ought to be parallel with the last. The cases are
then clothed with leaders, so that they, with the illuminations
and stars at top, may all take fire together.</p>

<p>Fire trees may be formed by placing cases at an angle of 45
degrees, inclining upwards from the trunk, and at certain distances
from each other. The two last cases may incline downwards.
Cases may also be placed on the trunk itself, so that the
whole will resemble a body of fire. Fire trees are commonly
made about six feet long and three inches in diameter.
The cases are generally fixed to pegs. At the top of the tree,
a four-inch mortar is fixed, which is loaded with stars, rains,
or crackers. In the middle of this mortar, we may place a
case filled with any sort of charge, which must be fired with
the other cases. Brilliant fire is generally employed. The
fire is communicated, as in other works, by means of leaders,
which are fired at the bottom.</p>

<p>There is also another exhibition often made with the so
called <i>illuminated yew-tree</i>. The middle piece or stem
on which the branches are placed, is generally eight feet six
inches high. The branches all incline downward, and shorten
as they go up. The number of branches on each side is
six, and their length is determined according to judgment.
When the branches are fixed, place illuminating port-fires on
the top of each, as many as are required. Behind the top of
the stem, fasten a gerbe or fountain of Chinese fire, which
must be fired at the beginning of the illuminations on the
tree.</p>

<p>Fires are often made to intersect each other, which has a
good effect. For this purpose a perpendicular post is provided,
of any thickness, so that it is sufficiently strong to hold
the cases. There are two pieces of wood which go across
the post, two feet six inches apart and two feet in length. On
the end of each of these pieces there is usually a five-pointed
star. Six stars are mostly employed. Pegs are fixed to the
post in such a way that two of them incline upwards and two
downwards, both forming an angle of ninety degrees, or forty-five
degrees with the post. To these pegs are fixed half
pound cases of brilliant fire. All the cases and stars must
be fired at once. It is obvious that by this arrangement of
the cases, the fires must cross, and thus by intersecting each
other afford a greater variety.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. X. Of the Pyramid of Flower Pots.</i></p>

<p>This piece is formed by attaching to a post, ten or twelve
feet high, and placed perpendicularly in the ground, four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
rails or pieces, two feet apart, which must diminish in length,
so as to represent a pyramid. The bottom rail must be six
feet long. On the bottom rail fix five paper mortars, each
three and a half inches in diameter. Let one be opposite the
post, and the other four equally distant on each side. Load
these mortars with serpents, crackers, stars, &amp;c. In the centre
of each mortar fix a case of spur-fire. On the second
rail fix four mortars so as to stand exactly in the middle of
the intervals of those on the bottom rail. On the third rail,
place three mortars, on the fourth, two; and on the top of the
post, one. All the mortars must incline a little forwards,
that they may easily discharge; and the spur-fire rammed
exactly alike, that the mortars may all be fired at the same
time. The pipes of communication being prepared, carry
them from one spur-fire to the other.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XI. Of the Dodecaedron.</i></p>

<p>The piece, required in forming a twelve sided figure, is
prepared in the following manner: A ball must be turned
out of solid wood, fourteen inches in diameter, and its surface
is to be divided into fourteen equal parts. In each division
bore holes of a half inch in diameter, perpendicular to
the centre, so that they may all meet in the middle. In the
inside of each hole, let there be turned a female screw. To
all the holes but one must be made a round spoke, five feet
long, with four inches of the screw at one end to fit the
holes. In the screw end of all the spokes, bore a hole five inches
up, which must be bored slanting so as to come out at
one side a little above the screw. From these holes cut a
small groove along the spoke, within six inches of the other
end, where another hole through to the other side of the spoke
is made. To this end fix a spindle, on which put a small
wheel of three or four sides, each side six or seven inches
long; these sides must have grooves cut in them, large enough
to receive a two or four-ounce case. When these wheels are
clothed put them on the spindles, and at the end of each
spindle attach a nut to keep the wheel from falling off.</p>

<p>The wheels being thus fixed, carry a pipe from the mouth
of the first case on each wheel through the hole in the side
of the spoke, and from thence along the groove and through
the other hole, so as to hang out at the screw end about an
inch. The spokes being all prepared in this manner, a post
must be provided on which the piece is to be fired, having an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
iron screw in the top of it to fit one of the holes in the ball.
On the screw attach the ball and then in the top hole of the
ball put a little meal-powder, and some loose quick-match.
After this, screw in all the spokes, and in one side of the
ball bore a hole, in which put a leader and secure it at the end.
By this leader the powder and match in the centre are fired,
which will light the match at the end of the spokes all at once,
and by which all the wheels will be lighted at the same time.
There may be an addition to this piece by fixing a small
globe on each wheel, or one on the top wheel only. Gray
charge may be used for the wheel cases.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XII. Of Cascades of Fire.</i></p>

<p>Cascades of fire may be made of any size, and with cases
from a half pound to a pound, or more. Half pound cases
are usually the size employed. Cascades may be made either
fixed, or turning. The former are an assemblage of pieces of
wood, furnished with cases charged with Chinese fire, and
placed one above the other. The distance may be more or
less; sometimes from eight to fifteen feet. The latter, or
turning cascades, are constructed about four feet in diameter.
The wheel is made to turn on a pivot, and is put in motion
by attaching to it, in the usual manner, cases of white
fire. These play horizontally. The cases of Chinese fire,
which play downwards, are fixed to the wheel, or to another
wheel below this, or above it, according to fancy, and are
placed with their mouths downwards. Sometimes in fact they
play upwards, and for that purpose are made to incline outwards.
In the centre, there is a case or two of brilliant fire.</p>

<p>It is obvious, that this arrangement not only gives a motion
to the wheel, and to the cases of Chinese fire, but produces
in effect a circular sheet, which falls like a cascade.</p>

<p>By having an upright piece, stuck in the ground, on which
are fixed three or more horizontal wheels, or segments of a
circle, made permanent, and at about three feet from each
other, diminishing, however, as they go up, and also in their
diameter, a frame will be formed capable of holding a great
number of cases. The first segment may be four feet in diameter.
The top pieces may be of any length, so as to hold
the cases at a little distance from each other. All the cross
pieces are to be fixed horizontally, and supported by brackets.
The bottom cross piece, or segment, should be about one
foot six inches broad in the middle; the second, one foot; the
third, nine inches; and the top piece, four inches. The cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
may be made of any length, but must be filled with a brilliant
charge. Bits of wood ought to be nailed on the edges
of the cross pieces, having a groove cut in each piece, and
sufficiently large for a case to lie in. These bits of wood are
fixed, so as to incline downwards, and that the fire from one
tier of cases may play over the other. Leaders are carried
from one to the other, as before mentioned. Let there be a
pipe, hung from the mouth of one of these cases, covered at
the end with a single paper, which is burnt to fire the cascade.
Nine cases generally form the first tier; seven, the second,
four, the third; and three, the last. These cases play downwards,
except the three at top, one of which is vertical and
the other two inclining at an angle of about forty-five degrees.
The arrangement may be varied at pleasure. The only thing
to be attended to is, to fix the cases in such a way, that the
fire which proceeds from them may pass over the tier immediately
underneath, that the effect may be general and uniform.
Chinese fire may be used, as in the former instance.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XIII. Of Chinese Fountains, and Parasols.</i></p>

<p>The manner of constructing the wood work of a Chinese
fountain is as follows: Procure a perpendicular piece of
wood, seven feet long, and two and a half inches square. At
sixteen inches from the top, fix on the front a cross piece,
one inch thick, and two and a half inches broad; with the
broad side up. Below this, fix three more pieces of the same
width and thickness, at sixteen inches from each other. Let
the bottom rail be five feet long, and the others of such a
length as to allow the fire-pumps to stand in the middle of
the intervals of each other. The pyramid being thus made,
fix in the holes, made in the bottom rail, five fire-pumps, at
equal distances: on the second rail, place four pumps; on the
third, three; on the fourth, two; and on the top of the post,
one. Place them all, however, to incline a little forward, so
that when they throw out the stars, they may not strike
against the cross rails. The fire-pumps are to be clothed with
leaders, in order that they may all be fired together.</p>

<p>Cases for <i>Fire-pumps</i> are made in the same manner as those
for tourbillons. See <a href="#FPUx"><i>Fire-pump</i></a>, and also <a href="#FIRx"><i>Fire-pots</i></a> of various
kinds.</p>

<p>The effect of these cases depends entirely on the star-composition.
Stars, previously moulded, are introduced into them
along with meal-powder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>Parasols are also formed with Chinese fire. A horizontal
wheel is provided, and its circumference is clothed with
eight or ten cases of that fire. These cases may be five-sixths
of an inch in diameter, and, when inflamed, should throw
their fire horizontally. The fire, in this instance, is made to
resemble a <i>sheaf</i>; but the ordinary composition is generally
used. The cases, however, should play horizontally. To
make the wheel turn on its pivot, two cases of white fire are
attached to it. The parasol, produced by the fire, is from
twenty-five to thirty feet in diameter. It is formed in consequence
of the fire coming in contact, and producing a concave
sheet in its fall, resembling a parasol when extended.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XIV. Of Wings or Cross Fire.</i></p>

<p>Nearly similar to one of the pieces described, that of the
representation of a tree, is the cross-fire, or <i>wings</i>, a name
given to it, because it resembles the sails, or wings of a windmill.</p>

<p>In forming this piece, two sticks, eight feet in length, are
provided, and through the centre of each, a square hole is
made, to receive a piece of iron of the same size, through
which is a hole to admit a pivot.</p>

<p>When these sticks are put together, there must be a sufficient
distance between them to prevent their rubbing each
other. Five cases, charged with the composition of brilliant
fire, are fixed to each extremity, proceeding towards the centre,
at a short distance apart, and making in all twenty cases.
Four of these cases are placed at each end, nearly horizontally,
resembling the rounds of a ladder, the sticks being
nearly vertical; and the one nearest the centre is placed almost
vertically, or rather obliquely. The cases, being connected
with leaders, when fired, turn with the sticks in an
<i>opposite</i> direction to each other.</p>

<p>When three wheels are each furnished with two rounds of
white and coloured fire, and are so arranged, that the periphery
of each should pass over in succession at the distance
of ninety degrees of the perimeter, this piece is then called
by the whimsical name of the <i>love-knot</i>.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Sec. XIV.'">Sec. XV.</ins> Of Galleries of Fire, and Batteries of Roman and
Mosaic Candles.</i></p>

<p>Galleries of fire are formed by attaching, to long strips of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
wood, at convenient distances from each other, cases of Chinese
fire, which go off together. At the end of each case, is
put a marron, which, when the case is burnt, ends with an
explosion.</p>

<p>To form batteries with marrons, in connection with Roman
candles, they are tied at two feet distance from each other,
on long sticks, leaders being attached. These batteries, like
the fire gallery, usually accompany other fire-works.</p>

<p>We may here remark, that <i>thunder</i> is imitated by marrons,
which are fixed in the same way two feet apart. To produce
the effect, and increase the report, it is necessary to use them
of different sizes, from a quarter of an inch to three inches
caliber. They should be preceded by flashes of <i>lightning</i>,
which is imitated either with powdered rosin, or lycopodium,
in the manner described in our chapter on <i>Theatrical Fire-Works</i>.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XVI. Of Girandoles, and their Modifications.</i></p>

<p>Girandoles, for the purpose here noticed, are nothing more
than wheels which turn on a pivot. They are made of light
wood, with a rim similar to that of a sieve, and are clothed
with cases. Two cases are fired at a time, which burn in an
opposite direction.</p>

<p>Girandoles may be made to imitate a parasol, by placing,
horizontally, cases charged with the blue-fire composition,
or with that of the Chinese fire. Cascades may be formed,
by arranging them vertically, horizontally, and some at an
angle of ten or fifteen degrees from the horizon. The <i>bunch
of flowers</i> is represented by using, at the same time, cases
of <span class="xs"><sup>10</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>ths, <span class="xs"><sup>11</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>ths, and one inch, charged with Chinese composition,
as given in the table for calibers of that diameter. See
<a href="#CHIx"><i>Chinese Fire</i>.</a> Crackers are formed by attaching Roman candles
and Mosaic simples, and the sheaf is shown by fixing in
the centre some empty cases, on which are strung small rockets,
which are fired by the last case.</p>

<p>There are different modes of varying the effect of the girandole.
They may imitate the fire-rain, by employing cases
charged with that composition, which is given in the chapter
on <a href="#THFx"><i>Theatrical Fire-Works</i>.</a></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XVII. Of Cracking Caprices.</i></p>

<p>For this piece, a circular table is formed about twenty
inches in diameter, and one inch and a quarter thick. There
is a hole made in the centre, which is furnished with a pivot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p>Twelve inches from the circumference, and at equal distances,
eight holes are to be bored, to receive the same number
of pots, of two inches caliber; and, in the immediate vicinity
of the centre hole, which receives the pivot, four more
are made, for four other pots.</p>

<p>Eight arms, three inches long, project from the table at
equal distances, on which is fastened a hoop one inch in width.
The fire-pots are now put in the different apertures, which
are made sometimes to screw in; and the frame, of which we
have spoken, is furnished with cases of brilliant fire.</p>

<p>It is necessary that this piece should go off at three fires;
but the order of firing may be varied according to circumstances.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XVIII. Of the Projected Regulated Piece of Nine
Mutations.</i></p>

<p>A regulated piece, if well executed, is considered as curious
in its effect as any other in pyrotechny. It consists of fixed
and moveable pieces on one spindle, representing various
figures, which take fire successively one upon another, without
any assistance after lighting the first mutation.</p>

<p>I. Names of the mutations, with the colour of fire, and
size of the case, belonging to each.</p>

<p><i>First Mutation.</i>&mdash;This is a hexagon vertical wheel, illuminated
in front with small port-fires, tied on the spokes. This
wheel must be clothed with two-ounce cases, filled with
black charge. The length of these cases is determined by
the size of the wheel, but each must burn singly.</p>

<p class="centerx"><i>Second Mutation.</i>&mdash;This is a fixed piece, called a golden
glory, by reason of the cases being filled with spur fire. The
cases must stand perpendicular to the block, on which they
are fixed, so that, when burning, they may represent a <i>glory</i>
of fire. This mutation is generally composed of five, or
seven two-ounce cases.</p>

<p><i>Third Mutation.</i>&mdash;This is moveable, and is only an octagon
vertical wheel, clothed with four-ounce cases, filled with
brilliant charge. Two of these cases must burn at a time.
In this wheel, we may make changes of fire.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Mutation.</i>&mdash;This is a fixed sun of brilliant fire,
consisting of twelve four-ounce cases. The necks of these
cases must be a little larger than those of four-ounce wheel
cases. In this mutation, may be made a change of fire, by
filling the cases half with brilliant charge, and half with
gray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fifth Mutation.</i>&mdash;This is a fixed piece called the <i>porcupine
quills</i>. This piece consists of twelve spokes, standing perpendicular
to the block in which they are fixed. On each of
these spokes, near the end, must be placed a four-ounce case
of brilliant fire. All these cases must incline either to the
right or left, so that they may all play one way.</p>

<p><i>Sixth Mutation.</i>&mdash;This is a standing piece called the cross
fire. This mutation consists of eight spokes fixed in a block.
Near the end of each of the spokes, must be tied two
four-ounce cases of white charge, one across the other; so
that the fires from the cases on one spoke may intersect the
fire from the cases on the other.</p>

<p><i>Seventh Mutation.</i>&mdash;This is a fixed wheel with two circular
fells, on which are placed sixteen eight-ounce cases of
brilliant fire, in the form of a star. This piece is called a
fixed star of <i>wild fire</i>.</p>

<p><i>Eighth Mutation.</i>&mdash;This is a beautiful piece, called a brilliant
star piece. It consists of six spokes, which are strengthened
by two fells of a hexagon form, at some distance from
each other. At the end of each spoke, in the front, is fixed
a brilliant star of five points; and on each side of every star
is placed a four-ounce case of black or gray charge. These
cases must be placed with their mouths sidewise, so that
their fires may cross each other.</p>

<p><i>Ninth Mutation.</i>&mdash;This is a wheel piece. It is composed
of six long spokes, with a hexagon vertical wheel at the end
of each. These wheels run on spindles in front of the spokes.
All the wheels are lighted together. Two-ounce cases will
be sufficient for these wheels, and may be filled with any
coloured charge.</p>

<p>II. With respect to the proportion of these mutations,
with the method of conveying the fire from one to the other,
and the distance they stand from each other on the spindle,
the following general remarks will be sufficient.</p>

<p>The <i>first mutation</i> must be a hexagon vertical wheel fourteen
inches in diameter. On one side of the block, whose
diameter is two and one-fourth inches, is fixed a tin barrel.
This barrel must be a little less in diameter than the nave.
Let the length of the barrel, and block be six inches. Having
fixed the cases on the wheel, carry a leader, from the
tail of the last case, into the tin barrel, through a hole, made
on purpose, two inches from the block. At the end of this
leader, let there be about one inch, or two, of loose match;
but be careful to secure the hole, in which the pipe is put, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
prevent any sparks falling in, which would light the second
mutation before its time, and confuse the whole.</p>

<p>The <i>second mutation</i> is thus made. Have a nave, turned
two and a half inches in diameter, and three long; then let
half an inch of that end, which faces the first wheel, be turned,
so as to fit easy into the tin barrel of the first mutation,
which must turn round it without touching. On the other
end of the block, fix a tin barrel No. 2. This barrel must
be six inches long, and only half an inch of it to fit on the
block. Round the nave, fix five spokes, one inch and a half
long each. The diameter of the spokes must be equal to a
two-ounce former. On these spokes, put five seven-inch
two-ounce cases of spur-fire, and carry leaders from the
mouth of one to the other, that they may all light together.
Then, from the mouth of one of these cases, carry a leader
through a hole bored slantwise in the nave, from between the
spokes to the front of the block, near the spindle hole. The
end of this leader must project out of the hole into the barrel
of the first mutation; so that, when the pipe, which comes
from the end of the last case on the first wheel, flashes, it
may take fire and light the second mutation. To communicate
the fire to the third mutation, bore a hole near the bottom
of one of the five cases to the composition; and from
thence carry a leader into a hole, made in the middle of the
barrel. This hole must be covered with pasted paper.</p>

<p>The <i>third mutation</i> may be either an octagon or hexagon
wheel, twenty inches in diameter. Let the nave be three and
a quarter inches in diameter, and three and a half in length.
One and a half inches of the front of the nave must be made
to fit in the barrel No. 2. On the other end of the block,
fix a tin barrel No. 3. This barrel must be six and a half
inches in length, one inch of which must fit over the block.
The cases of this wheel must burn two at a time, and, from
the mouths of the two first cases, carry a leader through
holes in the nave, into the barrel of the second mutation, after
the usual manner. But besides these leaders, let a pipe
go across the wheel from one of the first cases to the other.
Then, from the tail of one of the last cases, carry a pipe into
a hole in the middle of the barrel No. 3: at the end of this
pipe, let there be some loose quick match.</p>

<p><i>Fourth and Fifth Mutations.</i>&mdash;Their naves are made of
one piece, which, from the barrel of the fourth, to the commencement
of the sixth, is fourteen inches. The block of
the fourth is four inches in diameter, having ten or twelve
short spokes, on which are fixed eleven inch eight-ounce cases.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
The front of this block must fit easy in the barrel of the
third wheel. Clothe the cases, so that they may all light together;
and let a pipe be carried through a hole in the block
into the barrel No. 3, in order to receive the fire from the
leader, brought from the last case on the wheel. The nave
of the fifth mutation must be four and a half inches in diameter,
and furnished with ten or twelve spokes, eighteen inches
in length each. These spokes must stand seven inches distant
from the spokes of the fourth mutation, and, at the end
of each spoke, tie a four-ounce case as No. 5. All these
cases are to be lighted together, by a leader brought from
the end of one of the cases on No. 4.</p>

<p><i>Sixth and Seventh Mutations.</i>&mdash;The blocks of these two
mutations are turned out of one piece of wood, whose length
from the barrel of the fifth wheel, to the block of the eighth
wheel, is fifteen inches. The block of the sixth wheel is five
inches in diameter, having eight spokes, each two feet four
inches long. At the end of each spoke, tie two four-ounce
cases, as in No. 6. All these cases must be fired at the same
time, by a pipe brought from the end of one of the cases on
the fifth mutation. Let the distance between the spokes of
the sixth, and those in the fifth mutation, be seven inches.
The nave of the seventh mutation must be five and a half
inches in diameter, and furnished with eight spokes. On
the front of them, two circular fells, one of four feet eight
inches in diameter, and the other, three feet eleven inches, are
to be fixed. On these fells, tie sixteen eight-ounce cases, or
pound cases, as in No. 7, and carry leaders from one to the
other, so that they may be fired at the same time. This mutation
must be fired by a leader, brought from the tail of one
of the cases on the sixth mutation.</p>

<p><i>Eighth and Ninth Mutations.</i>&mdash;The blocks of these may
be turned out of one piece, whose length from the barrel of
the seventh mutation to the block of the ninth, must be
twelve inches. The block of the eighth, six inches in diameter,
must contain six spokes, each three feet in length, and
strengthened by an hexagon fell, within three or four inches
of the ends of the spokes. Close to the end of each spoke,
in the front, fix a five-pointed brilliant star, and seven inches
below each star, attach two ten-inch eight-ounce cases, so
that the upper ends of the cases may rest on the fells, and
their ends on the spokes. Each of these cases must be placed
parallel to the opposite fell.</p>

<p><i>Ninth Mutation.</i>&mdash;The block of the ninth mutation is seven
inches in diameter, and holds six spokes, six feet long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
each, with holes and grooves for leaders, as those in the dodecaedron.
At the end of each spoke in the front, fix a spindle
for a hexagon vertical wheel, ten inches in diameter, as
in No. 9. When these wheels are on, carry a leader from
each into the block, so that they may all meet. Then lead a
pipe from the end of one of the cases of the eighth mutation,
through a hole bored in the block of the ninth, to meet
the leaders from the vertical wheels, in order that they may be
fired together.</p>

<p>Having thus given a brief description of this complicated
work, the performance of which depends so much on the accuracy
of its parts, we will now add a few remarks respecting
the formation of spindles.</p>

<p>For the larger pieces, the spindles should be made very
strong and exact. The instructions on this head are, that
for a piece of nine mutations, let the spindle be, at the large
end, one inch in diameter, and continue that thickness as far
as the seventh mutation, and from thence to the fifth, let its
diameter be three-quarters of an inch. The other proportions,
then, are, from the fourth to the second, half an inch;
and from the second to the end, three-eighths of an inch. At
the small end must be a nut, to keep on the first wheel, and
at the thick end, a large nut; so that the screw part of the
spindle being put through a post, and a nut screwed on tight,
the spindle will be held fast and steady. The wheels, however,
ought to run easy and without sticking. The fixed
pieces are made on different blocks, and the leaders must be
joined, after they are fixed on the spindle. The best method
of preventing the fixed mutations from moving on the spindle,
is to bore a hole a little larger than the diameter of the
spindle; and, at each end of the block, over the hole, fasten
a piece of brass, with a square hole in it to fit the spindle.</p>

<p>Similar to this piece of nine mutations is the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pièce Pyrique</i>
of the French, which consists of a great variety of fixed and
moving pieces, that are fired alternately, but in regular succession.
This piece we purpose to describe in the following
section.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XIX. Of the Pyric or Fire-Piece.</i></p>

<p>This, we have remarked, is a combination of pieces, calculated,
like the one we have described, to produce a variety
of fires, variously arranged and distributed.</p>

<p>The pyric piece commonly commences with a turning sun.
This sun consists of three cases, fixed to three arms proceed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>ing
from the centre. They are attached by means of a string,
and have leaders which go from one to the other of the cases.
See <a href="#SUNx"><i>Sun</i>.</a> This sun communicates its fire to a fixed sun,
formed of eight or nine strips of board, crossing each other,
or as many spokes from a hub, to which are attached, lengthwise,
as many cases, whose mouths are made to communicate
fire by means of leaders; so that each case presents the
appearance we have before described. Then follows a wheel
consisting of two or more concentric circles, and round
which are placed eight cases, with their mouths inclining a
little upwards. These cases are generally charged with brilliant
fire. They communicate with each other in the usual
manner, and afterwards with a fixed star, placed on a stick,
proceeding from the horizontal axis. This star is made of
two cases, charged with Chinese fire, with their mouths upwards,
and forming, with each other, an angle of forty-five
degrees. This fire is then communicated to another wheel,
and from that to one, on which, at certain distances, are fixed
six smaller wheels, furnished with six cases each; so that
the whole are put in motion at one time, the fire being communicated
at the same period. The appearance of these
smaller wheels, as the cases may be charged with the coloured
fire-composition, is such as to exhibit the motion of a
screw; which, however, depends on the structure of the
wheel. The fire from this may then communicate to other
wheels of the same kind, to cases of brilliant fire, to marrons
and the like, differently arranged according to fancy. Cylinders
of copper or tin, called <i>barrels</i> by some, are used in
the arrangement, in the manner already described. In fact,
the remarks we have before made on the regulated piece of
nine mutations, the manner of forming as well as of executing
it, will apply to the Pyric-piece.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XX. Of Sundry Illuminated Figures.</i></p>

<p>There are various illuminated pieces, some of which we
purpose to notice in this section.</p>

<p>The illuminated pyramid, with <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Archimedian'">Archimedean</ins> screws, a
globe, and vertical sun, may be exhibited in the following
manner: Let a pyramid be made twenty-one feet in height,
and the height of the pedestal six feet, and breadth nine feet,
having a space between the rails of six inches. They must
be made as thin as possible, and in all put port-fires at intervals
of four inches. The <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Archimedian'">Archimedean</ins> screws are placed on
the pedestal. They are nothing more than double spiral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
wheels, on which the cases are placed, but horizontally instead
of obliquely. The vertical sun, placed four feet below the
top of the pyramid, may consist of twelve rays. The globe
on the top may be made in proportion to the pyramid. The
leaders must be prepared and arranged in such a manner,
that all the illuminating port-fires, or lances, screws, globe,
and sun may take fire together.</p>

<p>Transparent stars with illuminated rays are formed, by
making a strong circular block or body for the star, two feet
in diameter, and attaching to it illuminated rays. In the
centre of the front of the body, fix a spindle, on which put a
double triangular wheel, six inches in diameter, clothed with
two-ounce cases of brilliant charge. The cases on this wheel
must burn only one at a time.</p>

<p>Round the edge of the body, nail a hoop made of thin
wood or tin, which must project in front six or seven inches.
In this hoop, cut three or four holes to let out the smoke
from the wheel. The star may be cut out of strong pasteboard
or tin in the following manner: Cut a round piece of
pasteboard, two feet in diameter, on which draw a star, and
cut it out. Over the vacancy, paste Persian silk, and paint
the letters yellow; and also four of the rays yellow, and four
red. This transparent star is to be fixed to the wooden hoop
by a screw, to take off and on. The illuminated rays are
made of thin wood, with tin sockets, fixed on their sides,
within four inches of each other. In these rockets, put the
illuminating port-fires, or lances; and behind the point of
each ray, attach a half pound case of gray, black, or Chinese
fire. The illuminated rays are to be lighted at the same
time as the triangular wheel, or after it is burnt out. This
may be done by a tin barrel, in the manner described in the
regulated piece. Into this barrel, carry a leader from the
illuminated rays, through the back of the star, which must
be met by another leader, brought from the tail of the last
case on the wheel.</p>

<p>The regulated illuminated spiral piece, with a projected
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'star weeel'">star wheel</ins>, also illuminated, is made by procuring a block,
eight inches in diameter, and putting in six iron spokes,
which serve for spindles for the spiral wheels. These wheels
are made one and a half feet in diameter, and three feet in
height. The spindles must be of sufficient length to keep
the wheels four or five inches from one another. At the
end of each spindle, put a screw nut. On these spindles,
the wheels, that hang downwards, are to run. On the spindles,
which stand upwards, must be a shoulder, for the blocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
of the wheels to run on. The projected star wheel turns on
the same spindle on which the large block is fixed. This
spindle must be long enough to admit the star-wheel to project
a little before the spiral wheels. The exterior diameter of
the star wheel is five feet five inches. On this wheel, three
circles of iron wire are to be fixed, to which attach either
port, or other illuminating fires. On the block, place a transparent
star, or a large five-pointed brilliant star. The cases
on this wheel may burn four at once. The cases on the
spiral wheels must be placed parallel to their fells and burn
two at a time.</p>

<p>In order to make a figure-piece, with five-pointed stars, illuminated,
all that is necessary is to have a vertical wheel
about one foot in diameter, and furnished with six four-ounce
cases of different coloured charge, which must burn
double. On the frame of the figure piece, fix five-pointed brilliant
or blue stars, rammed four inches with composition.
Let the space between each star be eight inches, and, at
each point, fix a gerbe or case of Chinese fire. The gerbe,
stars, and wheel are to be lighted at the same time.</p>

<p>The illuminated star wheel may be formed by procuring
a fell about four feet in diameter, and placing, within this
fell, three circles of iron wire, one smaller than the other, so
that the diameter of the least may be about ten inches.
Place the port, or other fires on these fells, with their mouths
inclining outwards, and the port-fires on the points of the
star, with their mouths projecting in front. The exterior fell
must be clothed with four-ounce cases of gray charge. They
must burn four at a time and be lighted at the same time
with the illuminations.</p>

<p>The illuminated regulating piece as it is called, consists
of flat wooden spokes, each five feet long, and at the end of
each, a vertical wheel, ten inches diameter, and clothed with
six four-ounce cases of brilliant fire. These cases burn one
at a time. On two of the spokes of each wheel, two port-fires
are attached, which must be lighted with the first case
of the wheel. On each spoke, behind the wheels, place six
cases of the same size with those on the wheels. These
cases must be tied across the spokes with their mouths in
one direction, and be made to take fire in succession.</p>

<p>The diameter of the large wheel must be two and a half
feet, and its fell made of wood, which is to be fixed to the
large spokes. Twenty-four cases of the same kind are fixed
on this wheel, and burn four at a time. On the circles of
iron-wire, already mentioned, illuminating port-fires are attached.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
The star-points on the large spokes may be made
of thin ash-hoops. The diameter of these points, close to
the centre wheel, is usually eleven inches. On these, port-fires
are placed, three and a half inches distant from each
other.</p>

<p>The illuminated double cone-wheel is nothing more than
a double cone, formed of a number of hoops, and supported
by three or four pieces of wood, in the manner of the spiral
wheels. The wheel to which the cones are attached, base
to base, is two feet six inches in diameter, and the height of
each cone is three feet six inches. Port-fires, or lances, are
tied to each of the hoops, in a horizontal direction, with
their mouths outwards. The cases are eight-ounce, and
play horizontally, two at a time. The spindle for this piece
must rise three feet above the point of the cone at top; so
that its length will be ten feet four inches from the top of
the post, in which it is fixed, allowing four inches for the
thickness of the block of the wheel. The whole weight of
the wheel and cones must be made to bear on a shoulder in
the spindle, on which the block of the wheel is to turn. On
the top of the spindle, fix a sun, composed of sixteen four-ounce
cases of brilliant fire. These cases must be stuck into
a block, six inches in diameter. In the front of this sun, put
a circular vertical wheel, sixteen inches in diameter. On the
front of this wheel, form a spiral with wire, to which attach
illuminations in the usual manner. This wheel is to be fired,
when the cones are burnt out, which may be done as before
described. The sun must not be fired, until the vertical
wheel is burnt out. Three vertical wheels illuminated, which
turn on their own naves upon a horizontal table, is a piece
readily formed. It consists in having a table, three feet in
diameter fixed horizontally on the top of a post, with three
wheels that turn round on it. There are three spokes, joined
to a triangular flat piece of wood, in the middle of which, a
hole is made to fit easily over a spindle placed in the centre
of the table. There are three pieces of wood four or five
inches long, and two inches square, fixed on the under
sides of the spokes. In these pieces, holes are made lengthwise,
to receive the thin parts of the blocks of the wheels,
which, when in, are prevented from coming out by a small
iron pin that runs through the end of each. The three vertical
octagon wheels, each eighteen inches in diameter, have
blocks sufficiently long, for three or four inches to rest on
the table. Round these a number of sharp points of wire
are driven, (which must not project out of the blocks more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
than <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span>th of an inch), and the clothing is affixed in the
usual manner. The use of the points is this, that, when the
blocks turn round, they will stick in the table and assist in
giving a uniform motion to the wheel. On the front of the
wheels, make four or five circles of strong wire, or flat hoops,
and tie, on these circles, as many illuminations, as they will
hold, at two inches from each other. Spiral lines may be
made instead of circles. When illuminations are fixed in a
spiral line, in the front of a wheel, they ought to be placed
on the slant. The cases for these wheels may be filled with
any coloured charge, but must burn only one at a time. A
globe, or spiral wheel may be put on the spindle, so that its
fire may play over the vertical wheels. The wheels must be
lighted at the same time, and the illuminations, after two
cases of each wheel are consumed.</p>

<p>The vertical scroll wheel is formed by taking a block of
a moderate size, and fixing in it four flat spokes, and, on
them, a flat circular fell of wood. Round the front of this
fell, port-fires are placed; and on the front of the spokes a
scroll is formed either with a hoop or strong iron-wire. On
this scroll, tie cases of brilliant fire in proportion to the
wheel, head to tail. When the first case near the fell is
lighted, the fire is communicated in succession. The grand
volute, with a projected wheel in front, is made in the following
manner: Two hoops are formed of strong iron wire,
one of six feet in diameter, and the other of four feet two
inches. These hoops must be joined to scrolls, formed according
to fancy, of the same kind of wire. On these, tie,
with iron wire, as many illuminating port-fires, as they will
carry, at two inches distance. Prepare then a circular wheel
of four spokes, three feet six inches in diameter, and, on its
fell, tie as many four-ounce cases, head to tail, as will complete
the circle, only allowing a sufficient distance between
the cases, that the fire may pass free. On each spoke, fix a
four-ounce case, about three inches from the fell of the
wheel. These cases are to burn one at a time, and the first
of them to begin with those on the fell, of which four are to
burn at a time. On the front of the wheel, form a spiral
line with strong wire, on which tie port-fires, with their
mouths to face the same way as the cases on the wheel. All
these port-fires must be fired with the second cases on the
wheel.</p>

<p>The spokes of the wheel must be formed of wood, and
made to screw into a block in the centre, and each spoke
should be four feet six inches in length. In the top of each,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
fix a spindle, and, in each spindle, put a spiral wheel of eight
spokes. The blocks of these wheels must have a hole at top
for the centre cases, and the spindle must be furnished with
nuts, screwed on their ends, which should fit in the holes at
the top of the blocks. The cases of these wheels are to burn
double; and the method of firing them, is by carrying a
leader from each down the spokes into the block in the
centre, as in the dodecaedron; but the centre cases of each
wheel must begin with the two last cases as usual. The
large circular wheel in front ought to have a tin barrel on
its block; into which a pipe must be carried from one of the
second cases on the wheel. This pipe, being met by another
from the large block, in which the eight spokes are
screwed, will fire all the spiral wheels, and the illuminating
port-fires at the same time. The cases of the projected
wheel may be filled with a white charge, and those of the
spiral wheels with a gray.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXI. Of the Spiral or Endless Screw, and Waved Fire.</i></p>

<p>This piece is formed in the same manner as the single and
double cones; and, in fact, is the same as the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Archimedian'">Archimedean</ins>
screw, which we have already described. The serpentine
form which characterizes the spiral piece, is given to it by
the particular arrangement of the lances of illumination. The
cone receives its motion from the cases of white-fire; the
fire of which is communicated by leaders to the cases of
port-fire, or lances of illumination. They must burn the
same length of time.</p>

<p>The waved fire is produced by having two wheels of a
similar size, turning in a contrary direction on the same axis,
and furnished with cases, which are inclined about 45 degrees
from the level of the table. These wheels carry four
cases each, and burn at the same time. They have been
made to carry forty-eight cases, and furnished, at their centres,
with lances, bent in a particular manner, so as to represent
the motion of serpents.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXII. Of the Decoration of Wheels.</i></p>

<p>Wheels, we have seen, may be made of different dimensions,
according to the purpose to which they are applied.
The most common are three or four feet in diameter, with
a nave of hard wood, and spokes of light wood. They are
sometimes surmounted with a fell, and frequently by seve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>ral
concentric hoops, placed at different distances from each
other.</p>

<p>Wheels, in general, are furnished with cases, and various
decorations. Some have two, three, four, and more fires;
but, if they are <i>finished</i> too much, the weight they thus acquire
would retard the velocity of the wheel. Their centres
may be finished in several ways; as, for instance, by attaching,
to the inner fells or circles, cases filled with white
lance-composition, placed at the distance of two inches from
each other, or alternately, white, blue, and yellow, or Chinese
gerbes, or cases of blue fire. We may also attach small turning
suns, the axes of which being placed upon the spokes.
They may also be made to resemble a mirror, by furnishing
all the spokes with white lances; and for the last fire, we
may attach four cases to the centre, or in its vicinity, placed
in such a manner, that their fire may issue from the interior
of the wheel. To this, we may add, two other cases, which
may cross the former. Leaders are fixed, and they are
lighted at the same time.</p>

<p>Automatons with all their joints, or articulations, have
been added to exhibitions of this kind, and with particular
effect. They are clothed with cases after the usual manner.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXIII. Of Globes, with their Various Decorations.</i></p>

<p>The first we purpose to treat of are the illuminated globes
with horizontal wheels.</p>

<p>The hoops for these globes may be made of wood, tin, or
iron wire, about two feet in diameter. For a single globe,
take two hoops and tie them together, one within the other,
at right angles; then have a horizontal wheel made, whose
diameter must be a little wider than the globe, and its nave
six inches long; on the top of which, the globe is fixed so as
to stand three or four inches from the wheel. On this wheel
may be put any number of cases, filled with any of the ordinary
charges, as the white fire composition. Two of these cases
must burn at a time. They may be placed horizontally, or
inclining downwards. When the wheel is clothed, fix on the
hoops as many illuminations as will stand, within two and a
half inches of each other, which are fastened on the hoops
with small iron wire. Attach the pipes of communication,
and arrange them so as to carry the fire to all at the same
time, with the exception of one or two, which are to receive
their fire for the last. The spindle, on which the globe is to
turn, must go through the block of the wheel up to the inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
of the top of the globe; at this place must be fixed a bit
of brass or iron, with a hole in it, to receive the point of the
spindle, on which the whole weight of the wheel is to bear.
When the globe is to be stationary and the wheel to run by
itself, the block of the wheel must not be so long, or the
spindle any longer than to raise the globe a little above the
wheel.</p>

<p>We may remark, that, while the cases of white fire composition
give to the piece a rotary motion, those of the lance
or illuminating port-fire produce the effect, which characterizes
in particular this fire-work.</p>

<p>With respect to fire globes, there are two kinds; namely,
one with projected cases, and the other with concealed cases.
If we have a globe made of wood, of any diameter, and divide
its surface into twenty-four equal parts, and bore a perpendicular
hole in each of these divisions to the centre, we
may then represent this piece in the following manner: In
every hole, except one, put a case filled with brilliant or any
other charge, and let the mouths of the cases be even with
the surface of the globe. Then cut in the globe a groove
from the mouth of one case to that of another for leaders,
which must be carried from case to case, so that they may
all be fired together. The globe is then covered with a single
paper and painted.</p>

<p>Fire globes with projected cases are made in the following
way: Prepare a globe with fourteen holes, and fix in every
hole except one, a case, and let each case project from
the globe two-thirds of its length. Then clothe all the cases
with leaders. It must be supported by a spindle made to
fit the hole in which there is no case.</p>

<p>The <i>bursting-globe</i> is nothing more than a globe prepared
in a particular way. It turns on a pivot, and is made by
uniting four segments. These segments or parts are fixed to
hinges, which open on the inside, and, when brought together,
are kept in their place by a match which goes round the
globe. The globe, it is to be observed, is furnished in the
inside with several steel springs, which, unless the globe itself
were tied, would force it open. When the match is
burnt, this effect follows and the globe separates into four parts.
It is furnished with lances and cases in the same manner as
those already described. The last effect is that we have noticed.</p>

<p><i>Globes, which leap or roll on the ground</i>, may be formed
by procuring a wooden globe, furnished with a cylinder;
and, having loaded it with the composition hereafter mentioned,
introduce into it four or more petards loaded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
grain powder to their orifices, which must be well stopped
with paper or tow. If a globe prepared in this manner be
fired by means of a match at the mouth of the cylinder, it
will leap about as it burns on a smooth horizontal plane, according
as the petards are set on fire. The petards may be
affixed to the exterior surface of the globes, which they will
cause to roll and leap as they catch fire.</p>

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXIV. Of the Representation of the Moon and Stars.</i></p>

<p>The moon and stars are represented in the following manner:
Make a wheel eighteen inches in diameter, by fixing
eight or more spokes in the nave; and then adapt a fell to it.
To the fell fasten eight cases of the black or gray composition,
and let the fire communicate from one to the other.
These cases give motion to the wheel. Furnish the spokes
of this wheel with cases charged with the white lance composition.
Make now a crescent of iron and attach it to the
spokes, or a little before the spokes of the wheel. In order
to fix stars to this piece, eight strips of wood, seven feet in
length, are made to cross each other at equal distances, and
nailed to each other in the middle; so that when this frame is
put behind and secured to the moon-piece, its arms will extend
some distance beyond the perimeter of the wheel.
These projections are furnished with five-pointed stars, eight
inches apart, and there is usually in all thirty-two. They are
made to communicate with each other by means of the cotton
match, as before described. The light of the lances renders
the moon very apparent, and the fixed stars resemble
those in the firmament. The representation of the moon and
seven stars may be performed by procuring a smooth, circular
board, six feet in diameter. Out of the middle of it cut a
circular piece twelve or fourteen inches in diameter, and cover
the hole formed with Persian silk, on which is to be
painted a moon's face. Also cut out of the board stars of
four or five inches in diameter. These stars are cut out with
five points and covered with oiled silk. On the front of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
large circular board draw a seven-pointed star, as large as
the circle will admit, and on the lines which form this star,
make several perforations, in which six-pointed stars are to
be fixed. A wheel of brilliant fire is placed behind the
moon, which renders the moon and stars transparent. They
will disappear when the wheel is burnt out; but then in consequence
of the communication of the fire to the large star
in front, which is formed of pointed stars, the appearance of
this star succeeds, and finishes the piece.</p>

<p>A large fixed star may be made thus. To each extremity
of the pieces of wood, arranged so as to cross each other, attach
two cases of the black charge. Their fire must communicate.
Near these cases, on each arm, place a turning sun of three
cases. These five suns are fixed at the same time, and when
they cease, the cases commence. These cases form the star.</p>

<p>The representation of flaming stars, with brilliant wheels,
is made in the following manner. After procuring a circular
piece of wood, about one inch thick, and two feet in diameter,
fix round it eight points, each two feet and a half long, four
of which must be straight and four waved, or flaming. These
points being joined on very strong, and even with the surface
of the wood, nail tin or pasteboard on their edges, from
the wood to the end of each, where they must be joined.
This tin is to project in front eight inches, and be joined
where they meet at the block. Round the front of the wood,
fix four pieces of thick iron wire, eight inches long each,
equally distant from each other. Cut a piece of pasteboard
round, two feet in diameter, and draw on it a star; then cut out
this star, and on the back of it, place oiled paper. Paint half
red and half yellow, lengthwise. The body of the star must
be left open in which must be seen a brilliant wheel. This
wheel is formed by having a block turned nine inches long, and
fixing in it six spokes. At the end of each spoke, put a two-ounce
case of brilliant fire. The length of these cases is
made in proportion to the wheel, and the diameter of the
wheel, when the cases are on, must be less than the diameter
of the body of the small star. The cases on the spokes in
front must have their mouths inclined outwards, and those
on the inside spokes, placed so as to form a vertical circle
of fire.</p>

<p>Carry the first leader, from the tail of one of the cases in
front, to the mouth of one of the inside cases, and from the
tail of that to another in front, and in the same order to all of
them. Put on a spindle in the centre of the star. This spindle
must be furnished with a shoulder at bottom, to keep the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
wheel at a little distance from the block, which is kept on the
spindle by a nut at the end. Having fixed on the wheel, fasten
the transparent star to four pieces of wire. When fired,
a common horizontal wheel will only be seen; but when the
first case is burnt out, it will fire one of the vertical cases,
which will show the transparent star and fill the large flames
and points with fire. It will then appear like a common wheel,
and represent the same appearance for twelve changes.</p>

<p>With respect to the formation of stars for regulated pieces,
we may remark, that they are made of different sizes according
to the work for which they are intended. They are
prepared with cases from one ounce to one pound; but, in
general, with four-ounce cases, four or five inches long.
The cases should be rolled with paste, and twice as thick of
paper as a rocket of the same caliber. Having rolled a case,
let one end of it be pinched quite close; then drive in half
a diameter of clay, and, when dry, fill it with composition
to two or three inches of the length of the case. At the
top of the charge, drive some clay; as the ends of these cases,
being seldom pinched, would be likely to take fire. Divide
the case, when filled, at the pinched end close to the clay, into
five equal parts; then bore five holes with a gimblet, about
the size of the neck of a common four-ounce case, into the
composition. From one hole to another, carry a quick match,
and secure it with paper, in the same manner as the ends of
wheel cases; so that the hollow part, which projects from the
end of the case, may serve to receive a leader from any other
work, to give fire to the points of the stars. These stars may
be made with any number of points.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXV. Of the Representation of Sundry Figures in Fire.</i></p>

<p>Animals and various figures may be represented in fire by
the following method: Take sulphur, reduced to a very fine
powder, and, having formed it into a paste with starch, cover
the figure of the thing to be represented, with this mixture,
having first coated it with clay to prevent it from being burnt.
After the figure is covered with paste, it must be sprinkled,
while moist, with gunpowder; and, when the whole is perfectly
dry, arrange about it several small matches, that the fire
may be speedily communicated to it on all sides. In this way,
all sorts of garlands, festoons, and other ornaments may be
imitated by fire of different colours.</p>

<p>A shower of fire may be connected with this representation,
by using cases of one-third of an inch in diameter, charg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>ed
with any of the following compositions. These cases should
be two inches and a half in length. They must not be choaked,
it being sufficient to twist the end of the cartridge. The effect
of these cases is to fill the surrounding air with an undulating
fire. The compositions are similar to those already
noticed; viz. for <i>Chinese Fire</i>, take gunpowder one pound,
sulphur two ounces, pulverized cast-iron of No. 1. five ounces;
for <i>ancient fire</i>, meal-powder one pound, charcoal two
ounces; and for <i>brilliant fire</i>, meal-powder one pound, and
iron filings four ounces. Sparks are also sometimes employed.
These are made in the usual manner.</p>

<p>Besides the common mode of forming sparks, as they differ
from stars only in their size and duration, (being formed
into small balls about the size of peas), they may be made
by the following method: Take sawdust of fir, poplar, &amp;c.
and boil it in water, in which saltpetre has been dissolved.
When the water has boiled some time, it is to be poured off,
that the sawdust may remain in the vessel. When nearly
dry, spread it out on a table, and sprinkle it with sulphur,
sifted through a very fine sieve, to which may be added a little
meal-powder.</p>

<p>If it be required to accompany the exhibition with bearded
rockets, (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fusées chevelues</i> of the French), so called from
the circumstance, that, when they fall, they make small undulations
in the air like frizzled hair, we may form them in
the following manner: Fill the barrels of some goose-quills
with the composition of sky-rockets, and place upon the mouth
of each a little moist gunpowder, both to keep in the composition,
and to serve as a match. If a flying-rocket be then
loaded with these quills, they will produce, at the end, a
beautiful shower of fire.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXVI. Of the Representation of Flat Stars, with a large
Body of Fire.</i></p>

<p>A star of five points, about two feet from point to point,
is to be made, and, in its centre, is placed a turning sun,
composed of three cases, and altogether not more than six
or eight inches in diameter. To this star five branches are
fixed, each of which is three feet in length; and, to the extremity
of each, are attached seven cases, with their mouths
outwards, and inclining about thirty-five degrees. One case
is then attached lengthwise, and forms the very extremity
of each projection. On each leg or branch, nearer, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
the centre of the star, must be three cases, fixed in an hexangular
form. The border of the large star is decorated with
Italian or fixed stars. The fire is communicated to the star
by means of a leader, then to the sun and the cases on the
branches.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXVII. Of the Single, Double, and Triple Table Wheel.</i></p>

<p>We have spoken of an arrangement of fire-works, which
moves a wheel on a circular board. That contrivance is similar
to the one we now purpose to describe.</p>

<p>The table-wheel is a kind of girandole, which turns circularly
on a round table, by having its axis connected with a
perpendicular pin, fixed in the table; so that its motion is
vertical, while it moves in a circular position round the table.</p>

<p>The table, as well as the wheel, may be of any size, according
to fancy. Eight or nine cases are usually attached to
the fell of the wheel, and in the direction of the fell. These
cases turn it with great velocity. The centre of the wheel
may be decorated with lances, or illuminating port-fires.
When double or treble wheels are to be arranged on the
same table, this is done by having the iron so lengthened,
as to extend over the table, and receive another wheel of the
same size; and by using a contrivance of iron, having three
projections, at equal distances apart, and turning in the same
manner on a pivot, or pin, fixed in the centre of the table,
three wheels may be put in motion at the same time. When
two wheels are employed, we may decorate one with blue
lances, and the other with yellow. When three wheels form
the same piece, it is usual to illuminate them, severally, with
white, blue, and yellow lances. The wheels of coloured fire
augment the beauty of the exhibition. In the centre of the
table, may be placed a pyramid, decorated in the usual manner.
Spiral wheels, globes, &amp;c. may be attached, if so required.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="ILLx" id="ILLx"></a><i>Sec. XXVIII. Of Decorations, Transparencies, and Illuminations.</i></p>

<p>Cut-work, as it is called, is often employed in decorations.
Various figures, letters, garlands, &amp;c. may be represented.
This may also be accomplished in tambour-work. Several
methods have been used to produce the same effect. Cut-work,
made in pasteboard, and the pasteboard blackened and
suspended in a frame, will, by the aid of lights placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
behind it, exhibit the design very perfectly. A figure of a
sun cut out of pasteboard, either fixed or made to revolve
in the manner before described, and illuminated by fixed
lights or revolving cases, is considered to be the best mode
of forming such pieces. In all instances, the more brilliant
the fire, the more perfect is the representation. Tambour
decorations are variously arranged; and, frequently, in the
termination of an exhibition, six or more are shown at once,
and sometimes with cascades, and turning suns.</p>

<p>In the place of cut-work, painted transparencies, made
with fine colours, and on Florence Taffeta, are usually employed.
Transparent paintings however, are not preferred by
some, as the effect, it is said, is not so perfect as when cut-work
is employed.  Morel gives a preference to the latter.</p>

<p>Transparencies may be formed with silk, or fine linen, and
even with paper, if previously prepared, by means of the
spirit of turpentine. The colours are painted in turpentine,
and transparent varnish is then applied.</p>

<p>Transparent screens may be prepared, by spreading white
wax, dissolved in spirits of turpentine, over thin muslin.
A screen, thus prepared, will roll up without injury. A
clearer screen may be produced, by having the muslin
stretched upon a rectangular frame, and prepared with turpentine
instead of wax.</p>

<p>In the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Œuvres de Diderot</cite>, t. xv, p. 349, are observations
respecting transparencies, and the manner of preparing them.
The process described is nothing more than we have noticed.
It consists in using the oil of turpentine, and sometimes a solution
of wax in turpentine. The colours are prepared
mostly with turpentine. Canada balsam, thinned by the
addition of the spirit, is also employed. Moveable transparencies
were exhibited with great effect in Paris. Transparent
figures were made to move continually in every
direction, which had a singular appearance. Artificial fire-works
were very accurately imitated, by producing a variety
of movements with different pieces of transparencies,
variously coloured. The sun, moon, and stars, revolving
wheels, &amp;c. composed a part of this exhibition.</p>

<p>With respect to decorations in white and coloured lances,
we may observe, that artificial fire-works are usually terminated
by some decoration, which corresponds with the subject.
For this purpose, triumphal arches, fronts of palaces,
colonades, rocks, &amp;c. are formed, and represented in wood-work.
These are usually clothed, and painted in water-colours.
From the rocks, water is made to issue, forming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
cascades, and a number of figures are put in motion. The
jets of water are terminated by jets of Chinese fire, or brilliant
fire-rain.</p>

<p>The furniture, or decorations, may be various, either with
white or coloured lances of illumination, hung four inches
apart, and attached to different parts of the figure, or building.
If it is in front of a temple, the columns are ornamented
with emblems, &amp;c. the fire-work being thus arranged:
<i>viz.</i> blue lances are attached to the columns, white lances
to their entablature, and to the emblems, yellow lights. This
however, depends on taste.</p>

<p>Decorations are also made with matches; but this mode is
not preferred, because so much smoke is thereby produced.</p>

<p>Figures, cut in paper, are illuminated in the manner before
described. But for this purpose, muslin is first stretched on
a frame, and its sides are covered with two or three thicknesses
of paper, which are pasted on. It is then blackened.
After tracing the design, or the subject of the illumination,
and cutting it out with exactness, the frame is put in a case,
sufficiently deep to contain a number of lights.</p>

<p>Illuminations, as an expression, of public feeling for some
event or memorable occasion, are by no means a recent thing.
Various modes have been adopted to render such exhibitions
more elegant, as well as more expressive. Hence, with the
usual display of lights, arranged according to taste and fancy,
transparencies, decorations, such as we have described, &amp;c.
have been more or less customary.</p>

<p>We mentioned, in the first part of our work, something in
relation to the antiquity of illuminations; but, as this subject
may be interesting, we deem the following brief remarks not
irrelevant.</p>

<p>Beckman assures us, (<cite>History of Inventions</cite>), that the origin
of illuminations is very ancient. The feasts, or holy-days were
celebrated in the days of antiquity, in various ways, among
which, that with lamps was very common in Egypt. It was
called the feast of the lamps, (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fête des Lampes</i>), and the
inhabitants of some cities in Egypt were obliged to illuminate,
with a great number of lamps, placed before their
houses. Herodotus (<i>lib.</i> ii, <i>chap.</i> 62), remarks, that, at a
particular festival of the Egyptians, lamps were placed before
all the houses throughout the country, and kept burning the
whole night. During the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">festum encæniorum</i>, the Feast of
the Dedication of the Temple, which, according to common
opinion, was celebrated in December, and continued eight
days, a number of lamps were lighted before each of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
houses. Such illuminations were used, also, in Greece and
Rome, and were called <i>Lampadaria</i>. An infinite number of
lamps were burnt in honour of Minerva, Vulcan, Prometheus,
Bacchus, &amp;c. On the last occasion, the illumination was
called <i>Lamptericæ</i>. It seems that the lighting of streets had
not been adopted at that period.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> At Rome, the forum was
lighted, when games were exhibited in the night-time; and
Caligula, on a like occasion, caused the whole city to be
lighted. As Cicero was returning home late at night, after
Cataline's conspiracy had been defeated, lamps and torches
were lighted in all the streets, in honour of that great orator.
The emperor Constantine caused the whole city of Constantinople
to be illuminated with lamps and wax candles on
Easter-eve. The first christians often illuminated their
houses on idolatrous festivals, in a more elegant manner than
the heathens. This was dictated by policy. The houses of
the ancients were illuminated on birth-days, by suspending
lamps from chains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>

<p>For illuminations at the present day, tallow is chiefly used.
It is clarified, for the making of candles, by means of alum.
M. Olaine in 1710 presented to the academy of sciences an
apparatus for the manufacture of candles. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bougie economique</i>
of the French is described in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de Paris</cite>
for 1782. The outline of the process for preparing them is
as follows: Take eight parts of suet, and melt it with one
quart of water; and after straining it, and returning it to the
same boiler, add the same quantity of water, in which was
dissolved half an ounce of saltpetre, as much sal ammoniac,
and one ounce of alum. The boiling is continued to evaporate
the water. The wick is made of cotton or flax, and rolled in
a solution of camphor in petroleum, and afterwards covered
in the usual manner with the above composition.</p>

<p>In using tallow generally, quicklime is recommended to be
added to it in fusion. When the quicklime subsides, it is
poured off. Another mode recommended is to melt the tallow
with vinegar, and to add to it a decoction of rosemary,
sage, laurel, and a small quantity of turmeric; the whole being
boiled until the water is evaporated. This communicates, it
is said, an agreeable odour, and a yellow colour. Different
modes of preparing tallow for candles have been used. See
<a href="#SALx"><i>sal ammoniac</i>.</a> With respect to ancient lamps, some account
of them has been published in the <cite>Antiquities</cite>, by Montfaucon
and by Passeri; and the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal des Savants</cite> 1682 and
1685 mentions the two lamps of Boyle and Sturmius, and
some account of the celebrated lamp of Callimacus in the temple
of Minerva. On the formation of lamps, and the purification
of oil, sundry patents have been granted both in
France and England. The argand lamp for burning its own
smoke, which it effects by a glass cylinder placed over the
flame, is one of the best improvements of the kind. The principle
of these lamps is the same, although variously modified
in shape and structure. For chemical purposes, an iron cylinder
is substituted for glass. A lamp, for the burning of
tar and turpentine, with steam, has lately been invented by
Mr. Morey, (<cite>see Silliman's Journal Vol. II.</cite>) Mr. E. Clarke
obtained a patent for a lamp calculated to burn tallow; the
principle of which is, that by the heat of the flame, the caloric
is conducted to the tallow by means of a piece of iron,
which is heated by it, and the tallow melts as it is wanted.
This lamp may be economically used, when common lamp oil
is scarce and high in price. A lamp is described in the <cite>Repository
of Arts</cite>, to burn tallow.</p>

<p>As a wick, besides cotton, several substances have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
recommended. The filaments of amianthus, for instance,
while they perform the office of a wick, are incombustible.
The <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de Verdun</cite> for 1748, announced incombustible
wick by sieur Lespar. Touch wood, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tussilago sarfara</i>,
and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">verbascum tapsus</i> of Linnæus, are also recommended.
In 1783, Leger announced, in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de la Blancherie</cite>, that
he had invented a match which would burn without smoke
and odour.</p>

<p>Lamps have been furnished with fixed and moveable mirrors,
to throw the light forward by reflection. The reverberatory
lamps, revolving lights for light houses, &amp;c. are of this
kind. Many patents have been obtained for such contrivances,
which we have not room to notice.</p>

<p>The inflammable air lamp for the table, described in the
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire de l'Industrie</cite>, is nothing more than a spirit of
wine lamp, and used in lieu of hot bricks, or vessels filled
with boiling water for the warming of dishes, &amp;c. In 1780,
M. Ehrman, in his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Description et usage de quelques lampes
à air inflammable</cite>, describes a chafing dish with inflammable
air, invented by Nevet, which operates by the combustion of
hydrogen gas.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Fixed illuminations are more brilliant and more magnificent;
as the lights are more numerous, as well as more diversified.
Wax, spermaceti, or tallow candles, or oil burnt in
tin lamps, or in glass cups suspended by wire, are all used
for the purpose. If the wick be dipped in spirit of turpentine,
it will take fire instantaneously. It is unnecessary to
make any remarks as to the arrangement of lights.</p>

<p>Large dishes containing melted tallow, and a wick proportionally
thick and suspended by means of a simple contrivance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
of tin, are recommended for the same purpose. Coloured
lights afford a variety. The appearance of coloured flame
may be produced by burning the oil in coloured glasses, so
disposed as to let the light pass through the glass, or by placing
lamps behind bottles filled with coloured water.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The coloured glasses which are sold in Paris for the purpose,
are formed with facets on the outside, which not only
produce the appearance of coloured flame, but also, according
to the number of facets, the refraction and reflection of the
light. Arches, pyramids, obelisks, &amp;c. are lighted up in this
manner.</p>

<p>The Pont Neuf, and the Seine in 1739, were illuminated at
the time of the splendid exhibition of fire-works. It is unnecessary,
however, to particularize on this head. We all
remember the splendid illuminations in all our cities during
the late war, which were indeed a true expression of our national
and individual feeling. Illuminations, in this country,
before that time were very rare; none we think since the
peace of 1783, and the union under the federal compact.</p>

<p>Phosphuret of lime, of the size of peas, thrown into water,
will afford, at short intervals, a brilliant flame of fire; for the
phosphuretted hydrogen gas thus produced has the property
of inflaming spontaneously in atmospheric air. <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Alchohol'">Alcohol</ins>, containing
sundry salts in solution, will give a flame of various
colours, according to the salt it holds in solution. See <a href="#ALCx"><i>Alcohol</i>.</a></p>

<p>Illuminated works are much admired by the Italians, and
particularly the <i>Illuminated chandelier</i>, which is considered a
great addition to a collection of works. An illuminated chandelier
is formed of thin wood with arms extending on each
side. Holes are bored in the front of the branches and in
the body, and also in the eagle (if it be added,) at top, and
distant from each other about three inches. In these holes,
we put illuminations, filled with white, blue and brilliant
charge. Having fixed in the port-fires, they must be clothed
with leaders, so that the chandelier and eagle may light together.</p>

<p>We may also observe, that, for the speedy lighting of a
number of lamps, at one and the same time, quick-match enclosed
in paper tubes has been used. This quick-match is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
sometimes made to communicate its fire to a sulphur match,
prepared by dipping strands of cotton in melted sulphur, and
from this to the lamp. Several methods are recommended
for this purpose; one of which consists in dipping cotton wick
in the oil of spike, and arranging it along the wicks of the
different lamps, so that when inflamed the fire may pass rapidly
from one lamp to another. In 1772, M. Renault, a
Parisian, announced in the public papers, that he possessed
a secret, by which he could light 2000 lamps in five minutes,
by means of a match of communication.</p>

<p>We have some experiments and observations on coloured
flame, by Mr. Morey, in his essay on heat and light, in the
second volume of Silliman's <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal of Science and Arts</cite>, p.
120. The experiments are curious, and worthy of remark.
If water, he observes, be put into one cylinder, and made to
boil, and the steam be led to the bottom of another included
cylinder, containing spirits of turpentine, the steam, when
let out under a moderate pressure, carries off with it a sufficient
quantity of the spirit to burn with a pleasant <i>white</i>
flame, free from smoke; but if the pressure be increased, the
flame will become in part or wholly blue. "Here," he adds,
"as in many other experiments, I have noticed, that different
coloured flames may be produced from the same materials&mdash;are
the products of combustion different?" He further observes,
that "if the steam of water, containing a small proportion
of the vapour of rosin, be driven against iron, at or
below a red heat, it burns with a pleasant <i>blue</i> flame, which
will be extended some way back into the column of the vapour,
intermixed with innumerable sparks of very white
flame, evidently particles of the rosin. If the vapours, when
the proportion of the rosin is very small, are made to pass
between two plates of iron, at or near a red heat, they can
be inflamed on the opposite sides of the plates, and will
then, sometimes, burn with an entirely <i>blue</i> flame, although
the vapour can not be inflamed, without the intervention of
the plates." He states other experiments, made with tallow
and steam, producing a <i>blue</i> flame. The <i>blue</i> colour seems
to be owing to the pressure made use of; for, in his second
communication, (page 122, of the same volume), he mentions
white flame being produced by the vapour of water;
and when it is in a sufficient quantity, there is <i>no smoke</i>. If
too great, combustion ceases. Speaking of the colour of the
flame, produced by mixed vapours, (of the combustible and
water), such as blue, blue and white, white and intense
white, he adds, that they may be imitated, at pleasure, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
the patent lamp stove, by burning tar, pitch pine, or mineral
coal and water. Newly made charcoal will take up about
three times its weight of water. "Sand, ashes, or fine clay,"
he observes, "answers well for mixing with the tar, &amp;c. If
the latter be made into a paste with equal parts of spirit of
turpentine and water, and cold lumps of it, of a conical
form, be placed on a table, and a flame applied, the vapours
burn without smoke for a short time, &amp;c. If enclosed in a
tin cylinder, and the vapour be made to issue through small
holes at the top, placed as before stated, or on a plate over a
chafing dish of coals, it burns with a very bright light, free
from smoke. If the cylinder be tight at the top and the vapour
be led from the inside at the top, down and through
the bottom, and there be made to issue in an oblique direction,
and from a number of small openings, it will burn with
a beautiful flame and supports and regulates, very accurately,
its own evaporation. The oblique direction carries the
heat, in part, beyond the cylinder, when the evaporation is
too great.</p>

<p>"Every effect may be produced in consuming the smoke,
and giving an intense white flame, by using a certain proportion
of water, intimately blended or mixed with these vapours,
that can be from an access of oxygen furnished, by
creating a very strong current of air, with a high flue." The
description of Morey's lamp stove, may be seen in the same
work.  The steam, he observes, may be furnished by a
small tin boiler, and directed to or near the bottom of the
tar. An <i>intense white flame free from smoke</i>, may be thus
produced from tar, rosin, rough turpentine or the spirit, alcohol,
oil, fat, tallow, mineral coal, pitch pine wood, and the
knots, birch bark, and pumpkin, sun-flower, flax, and other
seeds. With regard to pine wood, he adds, it is the easiest
managed, evaporates at a lower temperature, consumes a
greater proportion of water in its combustion, contains the
water within itself, and gives a brighter light than common
candles or lamps, and without smoke. The more volatile
parts are evaporated at a temperature below that of boiling
water, and burn well with three parts of the vapour of water;
the flame then, however, is nearly <i>blue</i>. Observations
on the application of this mode of producing light and heat,
may be seen in Silliman, p. 131, &amp;c. It appears, that Gay-Lussac
(<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales de Chimie</cite>, for June, 1819,) has commented
on Mr. Morey's plan.</p>

<p>Professor Hare (<cite>Silliman's Journal</cite>, vol. 2d, p. 172) also
observes, that the flame of hydrogen gas is rendered lumi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>nous,
like that of oil, by adding a small quantity of oil of
turpentine to the usual mixture for generating this gas; and
that the addition of <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>17</sub></span> of the same fluid to alcohol, will give
it the property of burning with a highly luminous flame; and
there is a certain point in the proportions, at which the
mixture burns without smoke, like a gas light. In the first
instance, he observes, when the ingredients are at the proper
temperature, the light is greater than that produced by
carburetted hydrogen gas. Speaking of this application of
spirits, the professor judiciously adds: "It might be serviceable
to <i>morals</i>, if the value of this article could be enhanced
by <i>a new</i> mode of consumption." We find, also, that the
effect of vapour on flame has been noticed by Dr. Dana, in
the same Journal, vol. 1, p. 40; by which it appears, that
when a jet of steam is made to pass into a charcoal fire, the
vividness of the combustion is increased, and also the low
attenuated flame of the coal; that it prevents the smoke of a
common oil lamp, and makes the flame brighter; that the
flame of spirit of turpentine, which is usually dull and reddish,
is rendered bright, and no smoke is formed; or when
the vapour of both are made to issue together from the same
orifice, and inflamed, no smoke appears; that a jet of steam,
thrown into the flame of a spirit of wine lamp, or into flames
which evolve no smoke or carbonaceous matter, produces
the same effect as a current of air; but that, in all flames
which evolve smoke, steam produces an increased brightness
and a more perfect combustion. Dr. Dana further
suggests, that steam might be introduced into the flames of
street lamps, which might be so contrived as to keep water
boiling, to produce the steam, and thereby cause a more perfect
combustion, and a greater quantity of light from the
same materials.</p>

<p>Count Rumford has shown, that the quantity of light,
emitted by a given portion of inflammable matter in combustion,
is proportional, in some high ratio, to the elevation
of temperature; and that a lamp, having many wicks
near each other, so as mutually to increase their heat, burns
with infinitely more brilliancy than the Argand lamps in
common use. To measure the proportional intensities of
two or more lights; place them a few inches asunder, and at
the distance of a few feet or yards from a screen of white
paper, or a white wall. On holding a small card near the
wall two shadows will be projected on it, the darker one by
the interception of the brighter light, and the lighter shadow,
by the interception of the duller light. Bring the faint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>er
light nearer to the card, or remove the brighter one further
from it, till both shadows acquire the same intensity.
Measure now the distances of the two lights, from the
wall or screen, square them, and you have the ratio of illumination.
Thus, if an Argand flame and a candle, stand at
the distances of 10 feet and 4 feet, respectively, when their
shadows are equally deep, we have 10<sup><span class="xxs">2</span></sup> and 4<sup><span class="xxs">2</span></sup>, or 100 and
16, or 6<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> and 1, for their relative quantities of light.</p>

<p>The author of the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire de l'Industrie</cite>, vol. iii, p.
365, in treating on the subject of illumination, mentions different
modes of illuminating, both with and without transparencies.
We know that various mixtures will produce different
coloured flame. Thus, arsenic will burn with a beautiful
white flame in oxygen gas; iron and steel will burn
also, affording a brilliant light; phosphorus and charcoal with
a white, and sulphur with a beautiful blue flame; zinc with a
green colour, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Again, we know that a mixture of nitrate of strontia and
charcoal will burn with a rose coloured flame; one part of
boracic acid, and three of charcoal, with a green flame; one of
nitrate of barytes, and four of charcoal, with a yellow flame;
and equal parts of nitrate of lime and charcoal powder, with
an orange flame. We also know, that cotton dipt in oil of
turpentine, or ardent spirit, rosin, camphor, &amp;c. will burn
extremely vivid and beautiful.</p>

<p>The author, whom we have just quoted, gives some remarks
on the various coloured flames, that may interest the
reader.</p>

<p><i>Felt</i> (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Feutre</i>, Fr.) he remarks, if put in the fire, will give
most beautiful colours, a golden yellow and a brilliant blue.
And this, he adds, may be proved by throwing pieces of old
hats into the fire; for these colours depend on the substances
used in dying the hat. He further remarks, that green oak
wood gives a yellow flame, and alcohol with sedative salt,
(boracic acid), a blue, and that, by uniting the flame of both,
the product, as to colour, will be a green.</p>

<p>The flame of alcohol is changed of various colours, according
to the salt it holds in solution. Of this circumstance,
Schatt was apprised, when he gave some formula many years
ago, on the manner of forming coloured flame. Reaumur
remarked also, the different colours which some metals assume,
when submitted to the action of heat, which is known
now to be the effect of oxidizement.</p>

<p>As respects the phenomena with felt, we are told, that,
if we throw into the fire the cuttings of hats, we will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
perceive at first a white flame, and then in succession
a blue, green, and violet colour; all which, our author
observes, proceeds from the verdigris and other substances,
employed in the composition of the dye stuff. There
is one fact, which he has asserted, which may probably be
explained on the <i>materiality</i> of light, so far as regards the
<i>formation</i> of colour, (not considering, however, the theory
of Bancroft, given in his <cite>Philosophy of Permanent Colours</cite>,
or the more philosophical one of Dr. Samuel Conover, of
Philadelphia, in the Transactions of the <cite>American Philosophical
Society</cite>), and this fact is, that the flame carries the colour
to the object which it illuminates, and that the object itself
actually partakes of the colour, in order to produce any particular
appearance. That colours, as visible to the eye, are
all formed in the solar light, and their appearance depends
upon the <i>absorption</i> of some of the rays of light, and the
<i>reflection</i> of others, is a doctrine which followed the discoveries
of Sir Isaac Newton. We have not room to notice
this subject, however interesting it may be in a philosophical
point of view.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt, that the art of colouring flame was
known for a long time. We are told, that the philosopher
Anaxilaus even pretended, that, by putting ink with the oil
of a lamp, or the liquor of the cuttle fish, the faces of the bystanders
will appear <i>black</i> by the light of this lamp! Sulphur
has the effect of rendering the visage pale and cadaverous.
Other persons, as Simon Sethe, advanced an opinion,
that, if we moisten the wick of a lamp with ink, or in a mixture
of the rust of copper, and having lighted the wick, and
placed other lights around it, the faces will appear, some black,
and some of a brass colour. Others, such as Cardan, say,
that, by making a mixture of wine and salt, and then reducing
it two-thirds by evaporation, the flame, which the wine will
then give, will make the <i>living</i> put on a cadaverous appearance,
if they remain in one posture. Malina also observes,
that, by burning a piece of woollen cloth well soaked in a solution
of salt in vinegar, the visage will appear frightful by
the light of the flame. But the process of J. B. Porta is
not less worthy of note. If good old wine, he observes, be
put into a bowl with a handful of salt, and set on live coals,
but not in the flame, and as soon as it begins to boil, is set
on fire, (the other lights in the room being extinguished),
the figure of each person will appear so hideous, as to produce
a mutual dread. The author of the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire de
l'Industrie</cite>, iii, p. 433, observes, that he has repeated this ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>periment,
sometimes with brandy, and at other times with
alcohol, with perfect success.</p>

<p>A cadaverous appearance is said to be given, by mixing
common salt with alcohol, in which some saffron had been
infused. When set on fire, and the other lights extinguished,
the effect, we are told, is very striking.</p>

<p>The so called <i>miraculous luminaries</i>, are nothing else than
solar phosphori, which are very numerous. Their effect is
to emit light in the dark, but not heat. Almost every thing
in nature possesses this property in a greater or less degree,
which depends on the absorption and subsequent transmission
of light. The eyes of various animals have this property;
cats and owls in particular. Snow possesses it in a considerable
degree. Putrid animal matter, fish, for example,
rotten wood, &amp;c. partake also of this property.</p>

<p>It may not be improper to notice, in a general way, some
of the substances, which are denominated solar phosphori.
The <i>Bolognian phosphorus</i> is the calcined baroselenite, (sulphate
of barytes), which, when exposed a few minutes to
the light, shines when taken into the dark like burning coals.
In water it emits the same light. This property, as is the
case with all other solar phosphori, it loses gradually; but by
heating it again, imbibes light. <i>Canton's phosphorus</i> is calcined
oyster shells. It is used in the same manner. <i>Baldwin's
phosphorus</i> is fused nitrate of lime. Various saline
and other bodies, as diamonds and precious gems, possess
the same property. Expressed oils and animal fats, when
heated to 450°, become phosphorescent.</p>

<p>Hanzelet (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité des Feux d'Artifice</cite>) remarks, that a
<i>stone</i> may be made to give light by water, if prepared in the
following manner. Take quicklime, tutty, and saltpetre, of
each one part; reduce them to powder, and expose them to
the action of heat. On the addition of water, light is said
to be given out.</p>

<p>When quicklime is mixed with essential oil, and brought
in contact with water, spontaneous combustion is said to
take place.</p>

<p>Fluor or Derbyshire spar, (fluate of lime), when pulverized
and heated to 212° Fahr., and then removed to the
dark, is very luminous. If writing be made on a copper or
iron plate, with thin mucilage or white of egg, and powdered
fluor spar, sprinkled on it; when the plate is removed to a
gentle coal fire, the delineated objects will become luminous,
and opaque again when the plate becomes cold. The lapis
lazuli has the same effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span></p>

<p>The phosphoric substances, which become luminous by
attrition or percussion, are numerous. <i>Homberg's phosphorus</i>,
which is nothing more than calcined muriate of lime, is
of this character. When struck it emits light. Without
either light or fire, a number of bodies will give out light.
Flints, and other siliceous stones, struck against one another,
appear luminous in the dark. Various other minerals have
the same property. Wedgwood (<cite>Phil. Trans.</cite> 179,) Coates
(<cite>Nich. Jour.</cite> 1799,) Westrumb (<cite>Crell's Chem. Annals</cite>, 1784,)
have written on this subject; to which enumeration we may
add the interesting remarks of Dr. Hulme, (<cite>Phil. Trans.</cite>
1800,) and the observations of Cabarris, in his Memoir, read
before the National Institute.</p>

<p>It may be sufficient to remark, that the shell-fish called
<i>pholas</i>; the <i>meduca</i> phosphorea, and other <i>molluscsæ</i>; several
insects of the species <i>fulgora</i>, or lantern-fly; the <i>lampyris</i>, or
glowworm; the <i>scolopendra electrica</i>; the <i>cancer fulgens</i>; the
medullary substance of the human brain, &amp;c. are all phosphorescent.</p>

<p>M. Dessaignes (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bulletin de la Société Philomatique, Octobre</cite>,
1810) made a number of experiments on solid, liquid,
and aeriform bodies, relative to the disengagement of light
by compression. Among other conclusions, he adds, that
water is the cause of the spontaneous phosphorescence of
bodies, such as quicklime, Canton's phosphorus, dry muriate
of lime, &amp;c. all which, when brought in contact with water,
emit light, which he attributes to the consolidation of that
fluid. The absorption of moisture, and its subsequent consolidation,
may, in some instances, give rise to luminous appearances.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lapis solaris</i>, Bolognian stone, or the present sulphate
of barytes, was discovered in 1602, by Casciorolus, a shoemaker
of Bologna. He came to Scipio Begatello, who at
that time was particularly known by his attachment to the
art of gold-making, and showed him this stone, under the
mystical name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lapis solaris</i>, on account of its attracting the
<i>golden</i> light of the sun, and its boasted fitness for converting
the <i>semi-metals</i> into gold, the <i>sol</i> of the alchemists!</p>

<p>Dr. Brewster (<cite>Edinburgh Philosophical Journal</cite>) made a
number of experiments on the colour and intensity of light,
evolved by different minerals, by which it appears, that the
yellow sulphate of barytes gives a pale light, while fluate of
lime, a blue and green light. Cellini (<cite>Treatise on Jewelry</cite>,
published near the beginning of the 16th century) was the
first who observed the phosphorescence of minerals; it does
not appear that he knew of the Bolognian stone. Grimshire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
(<cite>Nicholson's Journal</cite>, 8vo. vols. 15, 16, 19,) made a number
of experiments on the emission of light by bodies, when subjected
to the electrical influence; and, when thus treated,
sulphate of barytes gave a brilliant green light.</p>

<p>The <i>cawk</i> of the miners, as it is also a sulphate of barytes,
phosphoresces when previously exposed to heat.</p>

<p>There are two water fountains, both set in motion by the
action of heat on confined air, which, as it expands, forces
the water from an under vessel in jets. The first is called
the <i>illuminated fountain</i>, and plays when the candles are
lighted, stopping when they are extinguished. The other is
a fountain, which acts on the same principle, but by the heat
of the sun. The effect of the first is more or less considerable
according to the pressure of the air upon the water,
and consequently, to the degree of rarefaction which the air
undergoes.</p>

<p>The <i>chemical illumination</i> of some writers, by using oil of
vitriol, iron filings, and water, and inflaming the vapour as
it proceeds from a bottle, is nothing else than the inflammation
of hydrogen gas. The "white vapours," which they describe,
is the gas in question.</p>

<p>Having noticed the use of candles and lamps for illumination,
we purpose, in concluding this article, to give the
result of some experiments on the relative intensities of light,
and duration of different candles, made by Dr. Ure, which
we extract from his <cite>Dictionary of Chemistry</cite>.</p>

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXIX. Of Imitative Fire-Works.</i></p>

<p>Imitative fire-works are nearly of the same character as
the transparencies and illuminations mentioned in the last
section; but, as this subject may be interesting to some of
our readers, we thought proper for that reason to appropriate
a section to its consideration.</p>

<p>Imitative fire-works are formed in the following manner:
Take a paper that is blacked on both sides, or instead of
black, let it be coloured on each side with a deep blue,
which will be still better for such as are to be seen through
transparent papers. It must be of a proper size for the figure
intended to be exhibited. In this paper, cut with a pen-knife
several spaces, and with a piercer make a great number
of holes, rather long than round, and at no regular distance
from each other.</p>

<p>To represent revolving pyramids and globes, the paper
must be cut through with a pen-knife, and the space cut out between
each spiral should be three or four times as wide as
the spirals themselves. They must be so cut, that the pyramid
or globe may appear to turn on its axis. The columns
that are represented in pieces of architecture, or in jets of
fire, must be cut in the same manner as if they are to be represented
as turning on their axis.</p>

<p>In like manner may be exhibited a great variety of ornaments,
cyphers, and medallions, which, when properly coloured,
cannot fail of producing a most pleasing effect. There
should not be a very great diversity of colours, as that would
not produce the most agreeable appearance.</p>

<p>When these pieces are drawn upon a large scale, the architecture
or ornaments may be shaded; and to represent
different shades, pieces of coloured paper must be pasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
over each other, which will produce an effect that would not
be expected from transparent paintings. Five or six pieces
of paper, pasted over each other, will be sufficient to represent
the strongest shades. To give these pieces the different motions
they require, we must first consider the nature of each
piece: if, for example, we have cut out the figure of the sun,
or of a star, we must construct a wire wheel of the same diameter
with those pieces. Over this wheel a very thin paper
is to be pasted, on which is drawn with black ink the
spiral figure. The wheel thus prepared, is to be placed behind
the sun or star, in such a manner that its axis may be
exactly opposite the centre of either of those figures. This
wheel may be turned by any contrivance.</p>

<p>Now, the wheel being placed directly behind the sun, for
example, and very near to it, is to be turned regularly round
and strongly illuminated by candles placed behind it. The
lines that form the spiral will then appear through the spaces
cut from the sun, to proceed from its centre to its circumference;
and will resemble sparks of fire that incessantly
succeed each other. The same effect will be produced by
the star, or by any other figure, where the fire is not to appear
as proceeding from the circumference to the centre.</p>

<p>These two pieces, as well as those that follow, may be of
any size, provided we observe the proportion between the
parts of the figure and the spiral, which must be wider in
large figures than in small. If the sun, for example, have
from six to twelve inches diameter, the width of the strokes
that form the spiral need not be more than one-twentieth part
of an inch, and the spaces between them that form the transparent
parts, about two-tenths of an inch. If the sun be two
feet in diameter, the strokes should be one-eighth of an inch,
and the space between, one quarter of an inch; and if the figure
be six feet in diameter, the strokes should be one-fourth
of an inch, and the spaces, five-twelfths of an inch. These
pieces have a pleasing effect, when represented of a small
size; but the deception is more striking when they are of
larger dimensions.</p>

<p>It will be proper to place these pieces, when of a small
size, in a box quite close on every side, that none of the light
may be diffused in the chamber; for which purpose it will be
convenient to have a tin door behind the box, to which the
candlesticks may be soldered, and the candles more easily
lighted.</p>

<p>The several figures cut out should be placed in frames,
that they may be put alternately in a groove in the forepart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
of the box, or there may be two grooves, that the second
piece may be put in before the first is taken out.</p>

<p>The wheel must be carefully concealed from the eye of the
spectator. Where there is an opportunity of representing these
artificial fires by a hole in the partition, they will doubtless
have a much more striking effect, as the spectator cannot then
conjecture by what means they are produced.</p>

<p>It is easy to conceive, that, by extending this method,
wheels may be constructed with three or four spirals, to
which may be given different directions. It is manifest,
also, that, on the same principle, a great variety of transparent
figures may be contrived, which may be all placed before
the same spiral lines.</p>

<p>In representing cascades of fire, it is necessary to observe,
that, in cutting out the cascades, care must be taken to preserve
a natural inequality in the parts cut out; for if to save
time, all the holes are made with the same pointed tool, the
uniformity of the parts will produce a disagreeable effect.</p>

<p>To produce the apparent motion of these cascades, instead
of drawing a spiral, a slip of strong paper is to be provided,
in which there must be made a great number of holes near
each other, and made with pointed tools of different dimensions.</p>

<p>At each end of the paper, a part, of the same size with
the cascade, must be left uncut; and towards those parts the
holes must be made a greater distance from each other.</p>

<p>When the cascade that is cut out is placed before the
scroll of paper just mentioned, and it is entirely wound upon
the roller, the part of the paper that is then between, being
quite opaque, no part of the cascade will be visible; but, as
the wheel is turned gently and regularly round, the transparent
part of the paper will give to the cascade the appearance
of fire that descends in the same direction; and the illusion
will be so strong, as to appear as a real cascade of fire.</p>

<p class="center"><a name="AQUx" id="AQUx"></a>OF AQUATIC FIRE-WORKS.</p>


<p>Fire-works, which are exhibited on water, have a very pleasing
effect. Water rockets, in particular, are much admired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. I. Of Water Rockets.</i></p>

<p>Water rockets are generally small, from four ounces to
two pounds. When large, they are difficult to be kept above
water without a cork float. When this is used, it is tied to
the neck of the case. They will not dive as well with as
without floats.</p>

<p>The cases for water rockets are made in the same proportion
as for sky-rockets, but the paper is thicker. For those
which are driven solid, put in at first a ladle full of slow-fire,
and then two of the proper charge, and on that, one or two
ladles of sinking charge; then the proper charge, then the
sinking charge again; and so on till the case is filled within
three diameters. Then drive on the composition one <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'ladle-full'">ladleful</ins>
of clay, through which make a small hole to the charge.
Fill the case within half a diameter with corn powder, on
which turn down two or three rounds of the case in the inside;
then pinch and tie the end very tight. Having thus
filled the rockets, dip their ends in melted rosin or sealing
wax, or secure them with grease. When they are fired, six
or eight may be thrown in at once; but if they are all to
swim or sink at the same time, they must all have an equal
quantity of composition and be fired together.</p>

<p>In the rockets which burn in the water, there must be a
considerable variation in the construction of the mould, and
also in the materials of which they are composed. The composition
should consist of three materials mixed together,
<i>viz.</i> three ounces of meal-powder, one pound of saltpetre,
and eight ounces of sulphur. If the rocket is to appear on
the water with a beautiful tail, the composition must consist
of eight ounces of gunpowder, one pound of saltpetre, eight
ounces of sulphur, and two ounces of charcoal. When the
composition has been prepared according to these proportions,
and the rocket been filled, apply a saucisson to the end
of it, and having covered the rocket with wax, pitch, &amp;c. as
before mentioned, attach it to a small rod of white willow,
about two feet in length, that the rocket may conveniently
float. Cork may be used, as we observed, for the same
purpose. A certain quantity of meal-powder, without any
mixture, put at certain distances, must be used, if it is required
that these rockets should plunge down and again rise
up.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. II. Of Pipes of Communication.</i></p>

<p>The pipes of communication which are used under water,
must be made of thick paper, and when dry covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
drying oil, which must then be thoroughly dried. In oiling
them leave about one and a half inches dry for joints; as the
parts would not adhere where the oil was applied. The whole,
however, is completely oiled after the leaders are joined,
and the paste dry. These pipes will remain under water for
some time without injury.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. III. Of Horizontal Wheels for Water.</i></p>

<p>An octagon wheel is to be provided, made of flat boards
eighteen inches in diameter, so that the length of each size
will be near seven inches. In all the sides, cut a groove for
the cases to lie in. Procure a wooden bowl without a handle,
and on the top nail the wheel; then take four eight-ounce
cases, filled with a proper charge, each about six inches in
length. When the wheel is to be clothed with these cases,
get some whitish-brown paper, and cut it into slips of four or
five inches broad, and seven or eight long. These slips being
pasted all over on one side, take one of the cases, and roll
one of the slips of paper about one and a half inches on its
end, so that there will remain about two and a half inches of
the paper hollow from the end of the case. This case is to be
tied on one of the sides of the wheel, near the corners of
which holes must be bored, through which the pack thread
is put to tie the cases. Having tied on the first case at the
neck and end, put a little meal-powder in the hollow paper;
then paste a slip of paper on the end of another case, the
head of which put into the hollow paper of the first, allowing
a sufficient distance from the tail of one to the head of the
other for the pasted paper to bend without tearing. The
second case is to be tied on in the same manner as the first,
and so on with the rest except the last, which must be closed
at the end; unless it is to communicate to any thing on the
top of the wheel, such as fire-pumps, or brilliant fires, fixed
in holes cut in the wheel, provided they be not too heavy for
the bowl.</p>

<p>Before the cases are tied on, the upper part of all their
ends except the last should be cut shelving, that the fire from
one may play over the other, without being obstructed by
the case. Wheel cases have no clay driven in their ends, nor
are they pinched, but always left open; only the last, or those
which are not to lead fire, which must be well secured.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. IV. Of Water Mines.</i></p>

<p>A bowl and wheel, as above described, are necessary for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
this exhibition; but with this difference that in the wheel there
must be a hole large enough to receive the mine. These
mines are tin pots, with strong bottoms, and a little more
than two diameters in length. The mine must be fixed in
the hole in the wheel, with its bottom resting on the bowl;
then loaded with serpents, crackers, stars, small water rockets,
&amp;c. in the same manner as pots of aigrettes; but in the centre
fix a case of Chinese fire, or a small gerbe, which must be
lighted at the beginning of the last case on the wheel. These
wheels are to be clothed as usual.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. V. Of Fire Globes for the Water.</i></p>

<p>Bowls for water globes must be very large, and the wheels
on them of a decagon form. On each side of the wheels, nail
a piece of wood four inches long; and on the outside of each,
cut a groove, wide enough to receive about one-fourth of the
thickness of a four-ounce case. These pieces of wood must
be nailed in the middle of each face of the wheel, and fixed
in an oblique direction; so that the fire from the cases may
incline upwards. The wheel being thus prepared, tie in each
groove a four-ounce case, filled with a gray charge. Then
carry a leader from the tail of one case to the mouth of
another.</p>

<p>Globes for these cases are made of two tin hoops, with
thin edges outwards, fixed one within the other, at right angles.
The diameter of these hoops must be somewhat less than
that of the wheel. Having made a globe, drive in the centre
of the wheel, an iron spindle, which must stand perpendicular,
and be in length four or six inches more than the diameter
of the globe.</p>

<p>The spindle serves as an axis, on which the globe is fixed,
which, when done, must stand four or six inches from the
wheel. Round, on one side of each hoop, must be soldered
small bits of tin, two and a half inches distant from each other.
These pieces must be two inches in length each, and only
fastened at one end, the other ends being left loose, on which to
turn round the small port-fires, to hold them on: These port-fires
must be made of such a length, as will last out the cases
on the wheel. There need not be any port-fires at the bottom
of the globe, within four inches of the spindle; for, if there
were, they would have no effect, but only burn the wheel.
All the port-fire must be placed perpendicular from the centre
of the globe, with their mouths outwards; and must all
be clothed with leaders, so as all to take fire with the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
case of the wheel; which cases must burn two at a time opposite
to each other. When two cases of a wheel begin together,
two will end together; therefore the two opposite end
cases must have their ends pinched, and secured from fire.
The method of firing such wheels is, by carrying a leader
from the mouth of one of the first cases to that of the other;
which leader, being burnt through the middle, will give fire
to both at the same time.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VI. Of Odoriferous Water Balloons.</i></p>

<p>Odoriferous works are generally fixed in rooms, and, when
speaking of scented fire, we noticed such compositions as
would communicate an agreeable odour to the air. Water
balloons are made in the same manner as air balloons, but
very thin of paper, and in diameter 1<span class="xs"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inches, with a vent,
<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> an inch in diameter. The shells being made, and quite
dry, are filled with odoriferous composition, which must be
rammed in tight. These balloons are fired at the vent, and
put into a bowl of water.</p>

<p>Water rockets may also be made of any of the following
compositions, with a little alteration to make them weaker or
stronger.</p>

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VII. Of Water Balloons.</i></p>

<p>Having made some thin paper shells, fill some with the
composition for water balloons, and some after this manner:
Having made the vent of the shells pretty large, fill them
almost full with water-rockets, marrons, squibs, &amp;c. Then
put in some blowing powder, sufficient to burst the shells,
and afterwards fix in the vent a water-rocket, long enough
to reach the bottom of the shell, and its neck to project a
little out of the vent. This rocket must be opened at the
end, to fire the powder in the shell, which will burst the
shell, and disperse the small rockets, &amp;c. in the water. When
the large rocket is well secured in the vent of the shell, take
a cork float with a hole in its middle, which fits over the head
of the rocket, and fasten it to the shell. This float must be
large enough to keep the balloon above water.</p>

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VIII. Of Water Squibs.</i></p>

<p>These are generally made of one-ounce serpent cases, seven
or eight inches long filled two-thirds with charge, and
the remainder bounced. The common method of firing
them is this: Take a water-wheel, with a tin mortar in its
centre, which load with squibs after the usual method; but
the powder in the mortar must be no more than will throw
the squibs out easily into the water. The cases may be placed
on the wheel, either obliquely or horizontally, and on the top
of the wheel, round the mortar, fix two cases of brilliant fire
perpendicularly to the wheel. These cases must be fired at
the beginning of the last case of the wheel, and the mortar
at the conclusion of the same.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. IX. Of the Water Fire-Fountain.</i></p>

<p>A float made of wood, three feet in diameter is to be provided.
In the middle, a perpendicular post, four feet high
and two inches wide must be inserted. Three circular
wheels, made of thin wood, but without spokes, are fixed
round this post. The largest of these wheels must be placed
within two or three inches of the float, and must be nearly
of the same diameter. The second must be 2 feet 2 inches
in diameter, and fixed at the distance of two feet from the
first. The third wheel must be 1 foot 4 inches in diameter,
and fixed within six inches of the top of the post.</p>

<p>The wheels being arranged, take 18 four or eight-ounce
cases of brilliant fire, and place them round the first wheel,
with their mouths outwards, and inclining downwards. On
the second wheel, place thirteen cases of the same, and in
the same manner as those on the first. On the third, place
eight more of these cases, in the same manner as before, and
on the top of the post, fix a gerbe. Then clothe all the cases
with leaders, so that they and the gerbe may take fire at the
same time. The float should be tried first in the water, to
see if the fountain stands upright.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. X. Of Swans and Ducks, to discharge Rockets in
Water.</i></p>

<p>This experiment may be made, by forming swans, or ducks
of paper, leaving a cavity within. They are to be filled
with small water-rockets, with some blowing powder to
throw them out. Having made and painted some swans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
fix them on floats. Then in the place where their eyes
should be, bore holes two inches deep, inclining downwards,
and wide enough to receive a small port-fire. The
port-fire case for this purpose must be made of brass,
two inches long, and filled with a slow bright charge. In the
middle of one of these cases, make a little hole. Then put
the port-fire in the eye-hole of the swan, leaving about half
an inch to project out, and in the other eye, put another port-fire,
with a hole made in it. Then, in the neck of the swan,
within two inches of one of its eyes, bore a hole slantwise,
to meet that in the port-fire. In this hole, put a leader, and
carry it to a water-rocket, that must be fixed upon its tail,
with its mouth upwards. On the top of the head, place 2
one-ounce cases, four inches long each, driven with brilliant
fire. One of these cases must incline forwards, and the other
backwards. They must be lighted at the same time as the
water-rocket; to do which, bore a hole between them in the
top of the swan's head, down to the hole in the port fire,
to which carry a leader. If the swan is filled with rockets,
they must be fired by a pipe from the end of the water-rocket,
under the tail. When the swan is put in the water, the
two eyes are to be lighted.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XI. Of Discharging Rockets under Water.</i></p>

<p>Stands must be made as usual, only the rails must be
placed flat instead of edgewise, and have holes in them for
the rocket sticks to go through; for if they were hung upon
hooks, the motion of the water would throw them off. The
stands being made, if the pond is deep enough, sink them
at the sides so deep, that, when the rockets are in, their
heads may just appear above the surface of the water. To
the mouth of each rocket fix a leader, which must be put
through the hole with the stick. Then a little above the
water must be a board, supported by the stand, and placed
along one side of the rockets; and the ends of the leaders
are to be turned up through holes made in this board, exactly
opposite the rockets. By this means, they may be fired
singly, or at once. Rockets may be fired by this method in
the middle of a pond, by a Neptune, a swan, or a water-wheel.</p>

<p>A rocket, which is fired in the water, and, after burning
there half the time of its duration, mounts into the air with
great velocity, may be thus constructed. Take a sky-rocket,
furnished with a rod, and, by means of a little glue, attach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
it to a water-rocket, but only at the middle, in such a manner,
that the latter will have its neck uppermost. Adjust to
their extremity, a small tube, to communicate fire from the
one to the other, and cover both with a coating of wax,
pitch, &amp;c. that they may not be damaged by the water. Then
attach to the sky-rocket, after it has been thus cemented to
the aquatic rocket, a rod, and, by means of a string, support a
musket bullet, made fast to the rod by means of a needle or
piece of iron. When these arrangements have been made,
set fire to the match after the rocket is in the water, and,
when the composition is in part consumed, the fire will be
communicated through the small tube to the other rocket.
The latter will then rise and leave the other, which will not
be able to follow it, on account of the weight adhering to it.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XII. Of the Representation of Neptune in his Chariot.</i></p>

<p>This representation is performed by procuring a figure
made of wood, or wicker wood, of the proper size, and supporting
it on a float, on which must be two horses' heads and
necks, so as to appear swimming. For the wheels of the chariot,
there must be two vertical wheels of black fire, and, on
Neptune's head, a horizontal wheel of brilliant fire, with all
its cases to play upwards. When this wheel is made, cover
it with paper, or pasteboard, cut and painted like Neptune's
coronet; then let the trident be made without prongs; but,
instead of them, fix three cases of a very weak gray charge,
and on each horse's head, put an eight ounce case of brilliant
fire, and on the mouth of each, fix a short case of the
same diameter, filled with the white flame composition, sufficient
to last out all the cases on the wheels. These short
cases must be open at bottom, that they may light the brilliant
fires. For the horses' eyes, put small port-fires, and, in
each nostril, put a small case, filled half with gray charge,
and the rest with port-fire composition.</p>

<p>If Neptune is to give fire to any building on the water;
at his first setting out, the wheels of the chariot and that on
his head, with the white flames on the horses' heads, and the
port-fires in their eyes and nostrils, must be all lighted at
once. Then, from the bottom of the white flames, carry a
leader to the trident. As the figure is to advance by the help
of a block and cord, it must be so managed as to prevent its
turning about, till the brilliant fires on the horses and the trident
begin. For it is by the fire from the horses (which
plays almost upright,) that the building, or work is lighted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
which must be thus prepared. From the mouth of the case,
which is to be first fired, hang some loose quick-match, to
receive the fire from the horses. When Neptune is only to
be shown by himself, without setting fire to any other of the
works; let the white flames on the horses be very short, and
not to last longer than one case of each wheel; and let two
cases of each wheel burn at a time.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XIII. Of the Representation of a Sea-Fight with Small
Ships, and the Preparation of a Fire-Ship.</i></p>

<p>Having procured a number of small ships of two or three
feet in length, prepare a number of small reports, which are
to serve for guns. Of these, range as many as you please on
each side of the upper decks. Then, at the head and stern
of each ship, fix a two-ounce case, eight inches long, filled
with slow port-fire composition; but take care to place it in
such a manner, that the fire may fall in the water, and not
burn the rigging. In these cases, bore holes, at unequal distances
from one another; but make as many in each case as
half the number of reports; so that one case may fire the
guns on one side, and the other, those on the opposite. The
method of firing the guns is by carrying a leader from the
holes in the cases to the reports on the decks. These leaders
must be made small, and care must also be taken in calculating
the burning of the slow-fire in the regulating cases, that
more than two guns be fired at a time. To give a broadside,
let the leader be carried to a cracker, placed on the outside
of the ship; which cracker must be tied loose, or the reports
will be too slow. In all the ships, put artificial guns at the
port-holes.</p>

<p>Having filled, and bored holes in, two port-fires for regulating
the guns in one ship, make all the rest exactly the
same. Then, when the engagement has commenced, light
one ship first, and set it a sailing; and so on with the rest,
sending them out singly, which will make them fire regularly,
at different times, without confusion; for the time between
the firing of each gun will be equal to that of lighting the
slow-fires.</p>

<p>The fire-ship may be of any size. To prepare a ship for
this purpose, make a port-fire, equal in size to those in the
other ships, and place it at the stern. In any port, place a
large port-fire, filled with very strong composition, and
painted in imitation of a gun, and let them all be fired at
once by a leader from the slow fire, within two or three di<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>ameters
of its bottom. All along both sides, on the top of
the upper deck, lay star-composition, about half an inch thick
and one broad, which must be wetted with thin size, then
primed with meal-powder, and secured from fire by pasting
paper over it. In the place, where this composition is laid,
some little tacks, with flat heads, are to be driven, to secure
it fast to the deck. This must be fired just after the <i>sham</i>
guns, and, when burning, will show a flame all round the
ship. At the head, take up the decks, and put in a tin mortar,
loaded with crackers, which mortar must be fired by a
pipe from the end of the slow fire. The firing of the mortar
will sink the ship, and make a pretty conclusion.</p>

<p>Having prepared all the ships for fighting, we shall next
proceed with the management of them when on the water.</p>

<p>At one end of the pond, under the surface of the water,
fix two running blocks, at the distance the ships are to fight
apart, and at the other end of the pond, opposite to each of
these blocks, under water, fix a double block. On the land,
by each of the double blocks, place two small windlasses.
Round one of them, turn one end of a small cord, the other
end of which is to be put through one of the blocks. Then
carry it through the single one at the opposite end of the
pond, and bring it back through the double block again, and
round the other windlass. To this cord, near the double
block, tie as many small strings, as half the number of ships,
at the distance required. These strings, however, should
not be more than two feet each. Make fast the loose end of
each to a ship, just under the bowsprit, but if tied to the
keel, or too near the water, it will overset the ship. Half
the ships being thus prepared, near the other double block,
fix two more windlasses, to which fasten a cord, and to it,
tie the other half of the ships as above. When the ships are
fired, turn that windlass which draws them out, and so on
with the rest, till they are all out in the middle of the pond.
Then by turning the other windlass, they will be drawn back
again; by which method, they may be made to change sides,
and tack about backwards and forwards at pleasure.</p>

<p>For the fire-ship, fix the blocks and windlass between the
others; so that, when she sails out, she will be between the
other ships. She must not advance, however, till the guns
at her ports take fire.</p>

<p>In the exhibition of water fire-works, it is obvious, from
the observations we have made, and the different pieces prepared
for that purpose, that such exhibitions may be varied,
and even new pieces got up.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a><a href="#TOC_PART_3">CHAPTER XII.</a></h3>

<p class="center">OF THE ARRANGEMENT OF FIRE-WORKS FOR
EXHIBITION.</p>


<p>Jones (<cite>Fire-works</cite>, 8vo. 1776) observes, among other remarks,
that nothing adds more to the appearance of fire-works,
than placing them properly; though the management
of them chiefly depends on the judgment of the maker.
When water-works are to be exhibited, divide them into
several sets, and fire one set after every fifth or sixth change
of land and air works. Observe this rule in firing a double
set of works; always to begin with sky-rockets; then two
moveable pieces; then two fixed pieces, and so on; ending
with a large flight of rockets, or a marron battery. If a single
collection, fire a fixed piece after every wheel or two,
and occasionally some air and water works.</p>

<p>The rules, adopted in the arrangement of fire-works for
exhibition, are the following: If they are a double set, place
one wheel of a sort on each side of the building; and, next
to each of them, towards the centre, place a fixed piece; then
wheels and so on, leaving a sufficient distance between them,
for the fire to play from one, without burning the other.
Having fixed some of the works in front, place the rest behind
them, in the centre of the intervals. The largest piece,
which is generally a regulated or transparent piece, must be
placed in the centre of the building; and behind it a sun,
which must always stand above all the other works. A little
before the building, or stands, place the large gerbes; and, at
the back of the works, fix your marron batteries, pots des
aigrettes, pots des bins, pots des <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'sauccissons'">saucissons</ins>, air balloons,
and flights of rockets. The rocket-stands may be fixed behind,
or any where else, so as not to be in the way of the
works.</p>

<p>Single collections are fired on stands, which stands are
made in the same manner as theodolite stands; only the top
part must be long or short, according to circumstances.
These stands may be fixed up without much trouble. The
following is the order of firing works, <i>viz</i>:</p>

<p class="center wsp">OBSERVATIONS IN GENERAL.</p>


<p><a name="MILx" id="MILx"></a>
Laboratory-works comprehend all the operations of the
<i>workshop</i>, connected with this branch of pyrotechny. The
tools and instruments required for the laboratory, as well as
the substances employed in the different preparations, we
have already described.</p>

<p>Having noticed the origin of gunpowder, in the first part
of our work, the following remarks in relation to that subject,
namely, the history, of cannon, may be interesting.</p>

<p>For some time after the invention of artillery, gunpowder
was of a weaker composition than that at present used, or
than that described by Marcus Græcus. The first pieces of
artillery were rough and very inconvenient, being usually
framed of several pieces of iron bars, fitted together lengthwise,
and hooped with rings. These guns were first employed
in throwing stone shot of a prodigious weight, in imitation
of the ancient machines, to which they succeeded, and
were of an enormous bore. When Constantinople was besieged
by Mahomet II. in the year 1453, the walls were battered
with stone bullets, and some of the pieces were of
1200 lbs. caliber; but they could not be fired more than four
times in twenty-four hours, and sometimes were burst by the
first charge.</p>

<p>As mathematical knowledge increased in Europe, that of
mechanics gradually advanced, and enabled artists, by making
brass cannon of a much smaller bore for iron bullets, and
capable of bearing a much greater charge of strong powder
in proportion to their calibers, to produce a very material
and important change in the construction and fabric of those
original pieces. Guicciardin (<cite>History</cite>, &amp;c. <i>1st book</i>) informs
us, that, about 114 years after the first use made of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
unwieldy pieces by the Venetians, in their war against the
Genoese in 1380, the French were able to procure, for the
invasion of Italy, a great number of brass cannon, mounted
on carriages, drawn by horses. He then enumerates the advantages
which these pieces possessed, and particularly that
they could be pointed with incredible quickness and expedition,
in comparison with those formerly made use of in Italy.
But, as our limits will not permit us to notice all the circumstances
in connection with these pieces, it is sufficient to remark,
that this change in the formation of artillery has as yet
undergone no material alteration; if we except the introduction
of carronades, first suggested by general Melville, and
of Columbiads, by the late Mr. Barlow.</p>

<p>Glenie (<cite>History of Gunnery</cite>, 1776) appears to have been
the first, who gave the theory of projectiles in vacuo by plain
geometry, or by means of the square and rhombus, with a
method of reducing projections on inclined planes, whether
elevated or depressed below the horizontal plane, to those
which are made on the horizon. The experiments, and observations,
of Mr. Robins, on the subject of gunpowder, &amp;c.
may be seen in the article on gunpowder.</p>

<p>Besides the formation of cannon, by uniting iron bars together,
and strengthening them by hoops, (one or two of
which were made in Philadelphia in 1776, by a Mr. Wheeler,
of a superior kind,) others were made of thin sheets of
iron, rolled up together and hooped; and on emergencies,
they were made of leather, with plates of iron or copper.
Stone balls were used, and a small quantity of powder. In
the 13th century, cannon were used in a sea fight, between
the king of Tunis and the Moorish king of Seville. The
Venetians used cannon at the siege of Claudia Jessa, now
called Chioggia, in 1366, which were brought thither by two
Germans, with some powder and leaden balls; as likewise in
their wars with the Genoese in 1379. At the battle of Cressy,
in 1346, Edward III made use of cannon. They were
also employed in the seige of Calais, in 1347. Pieces of
ordnance were made use of by the Turks, at the siege of
Constantinople, then in possession of the Christians, in 1394,
or in that of 1452, that threw a weight of 1006 lbs. Louis
XII had one cast at Tours, of the same size. One of those
cannon was taken at the seige of Dieu, in 1546, by Don
John de Castra, and is in the castle of St. Juliao de Barra,
10 miles from Lisbon. Its length is 20 feet 7 inches, diameter
at the centre, 6 feet 3 inches, and it discharges a ball of
1000 lbs. It has neither dolphins, rings, nor buttons, is of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
curious kind of metal, and has a large Indostan inscription
upon it, by which it appears it was cast in 1400. The mortars
at the Dardanelles are represented to throw shells, or ball of
an immense size and weight.</p>

<p>Some do not consider cannon an European invention; because
it is asserted, that authentic documents exist of their
use in China, many centuries before they were thought of in
Europe. If they say, the testimony of the Chinese themselves
is not sufficient on this point, the fact of their great
wall being furnished with embrasures, fitted in such a manner
for cannon, leaves no doubt of their having been in
use at the time of its erection. To this, an additional argument
may be added, from their very ancient game of chess,
in which pieces have been used from remote antiquity, designating
engines of war, whose power was derived from
gunpowder.  Mr. Irvin, (<cite>Trans. Royal Irish Academy</cite>,) in
his paper on the Chinese Game of Chess, proves, that gunpowder
was in common use in China, 371 years after Confucius,
or 161 years before Christ; and Du Halde has long
since given documents to show, that the Chinese wall was
in existence 200 years before the commencement of the
Christian era; and consequently, for the reason before stated,
the use of cannon must have been of at least equal antiquity.
The Asiatic Researches contain some remarks to the
same point. There is a strong probability then, that the invention
of guns was of a much more remote date. It is not
impossible, however, that the same thing may have been invented
by different persons, in various parts of the world.</p>

<p>We mentioned, that it is much more probable, that the
use of gunpowder in war was derived ultimately from the
Chinese, notwithstanding the generally received opinion,
that the Greek fire was the progenitor of its discovery; or
that Bacon, or Schwartz, an obscure monk, has claims
to the invention. The mode in which the use of gunpowder
in war might have passed from China to Europe, is the
most probable and simple imaginable. Zingis Khan is
known to have conquered the five northern provinces of China,
about the year 1234. He must have known the common
use of gunpowder at that period, as it had been known in
China 1400 years before. In the <cite>Chinese annals</cite> of the Moguls,
by Yuen, as translated by Pére Gaubil, it is particularly
stated, that the use of cannon and mortars was familiar in
the wars and sieges of Zingis against the Chinese, both by
them and him, in attack and defence. It is most probable,
that he used gunpowder in his wars against Mahomet, Sul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>tan
of Carisme, whose dominions extended from the Persian
Gulf, to the borders of India and of Turkistan. It
is known, that he had a body of Chinese engineers in his
army, who, of course, must have been acquainted with the
use of gunpowder.</p>

<p>The conquests of Zingis would thus have spread the
knowledge of gunpowder, &amp;c. over the western part of Asia;
and the Europeans, in their crusades, may have had frequent
opportunities of becoming acquainted with it. It was just
after this time, that it became known, and was used in the
European wars.</p>

<p>Sir Francis Bacon (<cite>Moral and Political Essays</cite>,) observes,
that "ordnance was known in the city of Oxydraces, in India,
and was that which the Macedonians called 'thunder,
lightning, and magic;' and it is well known, that the use of
ordnance had been common in China above two thousand
years."</p>

<p>Beckman, (<cite>History of Inventions</cite>, iii, p. 434,) in his essay
on the origin of guns and gun-locks, has given, at some
length, the history of guns. All we can add here, is, that
the first portable fire-arms were discharged by means of a
match, which, in the course of time, was fastened to a cock,
and afterwards a fire stone and steel plate were used. This
fire stone was not a flint, but a compact pyrites, or marcasite,
(sulphuret of iron), which was distinguished by that
name. On each new improvement, the piece received a new
name; as, <i>büchse</i>, <i>haken büchse</i>, <i>arquebuse</i>, &amp;c. After explaining
the origin of these names, he adds, that the large
pieces were conveyed on carriages, called <i>karrenbüchse</i>, but
soon after also <i>canna</i>, cannon. Pistols are mentioned by
Beilay, in 1544, in the time of Francis I; and under Henry
II, the German horsemen were called <i>pistoliers</i>. The name
is derived from Pistoia, in Tuscany; because they were
there first made. Muskets received their name from the
Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">muschetus</i>, which signifies a male sparrow-hawk. They
were first used at the seige of Rhege, in the year 1521.
They were known in France in the time of Francis I. Brantome,
however, asserts, that they were first introduced by
the Duke of Alva, in 1567, and used in the Netherlands.
He also says, that they were made general in France by M.
de Strozzi, under Charles XI. The lock was invented in
Germany, in the city of Nuremberg, in 1517; it is uncertain
whether it is the present lock. In the arsenal at Hanover,
there are many ancient pieces. The oldest had on the bar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>rel,
the figure of a hen with a musket in its mouth; because
it is said they were made at Henneberg.</p>

<p>There are three species of cannon, the <i>gun</i>, the <i>howitzer</i>,
and the <i>mortar</i>. The gun is the longest piece of artillery,
employed at the present day: the <i>culverins</i>, <i>dragons</i>, &amp;c. as
they were formerly called, had calibers twice, and even
three times as long as those now used. Guns were originally
called <i>bombards</i>, and were eight calibers in length. The
term <i>pieriers</i>, from <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pierre</i>, a stone, were given to some guns,
because they were employed in throwing rough stones. The
carronades, derived from the river Carron, in Scotland,
where they were originally made, is a short gun, with a bore
about eight diameters of the shot in length. The howitzer
is a species of mortar, but longer, and used to throw a hollow
projectile, called a howitz, which acts at first as a
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'richochet'"><i>ricochet</i></ins> ball. The mortar is the shortest species of cannon,
and is used to throw bombs or shells. A stone mortar
is used in sieges, to throw stones upon an enemy. Besides
these descriptions of guns, there is another division, to
which General Lallemand (<cite>Treatise on Artillery</cite>, vol. 1, p.
20,) has given the name of <i>demi-guns</i>, under which he ranks
the <i>harquebus</i> on a swivel, the <i>rampart gun</i>, and the <i>repeating
gun</i>, or <i>musket</i>, of the Americans.</p>

<p>He observes, that the harquebus nearly resembles the
<i>amusette</i> of Marshal Saxe, has a barrel like that of a musket,
and carries a ball weighing half a pound or more; that
the rampart gun, or wall piece, is a large musket, that was
anciently much used in the defence of fortresses, having a
barrel of 5<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> or 6 feet long, and a ball from 10 to 14 to the
pound; and that the repeating musket is a gun, consisting of
7 barrels, all of which discharges 32 rounds in succession,
making 224 in all. With respect to this gun, the effect of
which we have witnessed, not only in the discharge of thirty-two
rounds from a single gun, but the combined effect of
seven or more barrels, the General observes, that the diameter
of the bore is three-fourths of an inch, and the weight
seventy pounds. It is placed, like the rampart guns, upon a
wooden frame, and has a handle at the breech to point by.
As to its use, he adds:&mdash;it may be advantageously employed
in the defence of places at the moment of assault; it may be
useful in the field, to defend parts of a line of battle, or entrenchments,
with few troops, and yet astonish the enemy by
a warm fire, when he ventures to approach. Its discharge
does not last a minute. It may be of great service in the
tops of ships of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span></p>

<p>The inventor is a Mr. Chambers, of Pennsylvania. We
witnessed its effect, when the President of the United States
visited the navy yard in Philadelphia, where the inventor
manufactured them; and also at Bush-hill, in the neighbourhood
of that city. Having examined their construction, and
also the shot it may be sufficient to remark, that the lead is
cylindrical, one end being flat, and the other conical, and of
such a size as to fit the caliber of the musket; that these
rounds are pierced with a hole in the centre, which is
charged with fuse composition; and, after a charge of powder,
one of these cylinders is put in; then a charge, then a
cylinder, &amp;c. up to 32. The lock is placed opposite the last
charge, so that when the first load is discharged, the fire
communicates successively <i>through the cylinders</i>.</p>

<p>A repeating gun has been invented by a gentleman of
New York. I have seen no description of it. The Marquis
of Worcester, in his Century of Inventions, in the 58th to
the 64th invention, hints at a similar contrivance; as for instance,
(Inven. 58th,) "How to make a pistol to discharge a
dozen times with one loading, and without so much as one
new priming requisite, or to change it out of one hand into
the other, or stop one's horse."</p>

<p>We may add, that, in 1764, M. Bouillet and Sons presented,
to the Academy of Sciences, at Paris, a musket of their
invention, which was lighter than the common kind, and had
the property of firing twenty-four times in succession, charging
and priming itself by a single circular movement of the
musket upon an axis, fixed for that purpose. In the file of
the <cite>French Gazette</cite>, for 1786, article Linberg, there is an
account of an invention of the baron De Walskohl. It is
the same, it would appear from the description, as the repeating
musket. Being once charged, it will fire thirty-six
times in succession. The experiments made with it were
satisfactory.</p>

<p>Many patents have been secured in this country, and in
England and France, for improvements on the musket and
rifle; but, in order to accommodate short-sighted persons,
M. Regnier's invention appears to be the first which consists
in an <i>optic</i> glass fixed in the butt, enabling persons of
that description to shoot with accuracy. This invention is
given in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de la Blancherie</cite> for 1779, p. 194.</p>

<p>In 1771, Moret, an armourer, announced a new constructed
pistol, which would charge itself, &amp;c. and in 1793, M.
Gass presented to the military committee of France, a pistol
of a new construction, calculated to fire several <i>ball</i> in suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>cession.
The <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal des Inventions et Découv.</cite> i, p. 121,
speaking of this invention, adds, that the means employed
depended entirely on the construction of the ball, which, instead
of round, was a cylinder, pierced in its length. This
small canal is filled with meal-powder, and serves as the
match of communication to the charges. This contrivance
is much the same as the one we have described.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Misson (<cite>Travels through Germany and Italy</cite>,) says,
that in the arsenal at Venice, there is an engine which will
light five hundred matches at once, and some very curious
arms of ancient make, among which is a small trunk, with
six little guns, which Carrara, the last lord of Padua, who
was famous for his inhumanity, sent as a present to a lady;
and was so contrived, that, upon opening of the trunk, the
guns all fired at once, and killed her!</p>

<p>With respect to the invention of the various incendiary
machines, we may observe generally, (as we purpose to notice
them in their respective places), that Greek fire was employed
in different ways, and was considered a destructive
composition; that rain-fire, bombs, lances, matches, fire-balls
and carcasses, torches, powder sacks, petards, &amp;c. were all
employed in more modern times for the same purpose; and,
lastly, that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fougette</i> of the Asiatics, called Indian rockets,
the Congreve rocket, the incendiary bomb of the French, and
the floating rocket carcass, are embraced under the same
head, and are all used for similar purposes in war. These,
and other subjects, belonging to military fire-works, we purpose
to mention in this, and the following chapters.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. I. Of Cartridges.</i></p>

<p>Cartridges are cases of paper, parchment, or flannel, fitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
to the caliber of the piece, and holding exactly its proper
charge. Strong paper is always used for musket and pistol
cartridges, and the French musket-ball-cartridges are capped
with flannel or coarse cotton. For heavy guns, they are made
of thick, and as the English call it, of <i>cured</i> paper, with flannel
bottoms. Those for field ordnance are all made of flannel,
and their size suited to the bore, or chamber of pieces,
for which they are intended. The ball cartridges, for wall
pieces, muskets, carbines, and pistols, are made of whitish-brown
paper, on formers of wood. A sheet of paper will
make six for wall pieces, twelve for muskets, sixteen for carbines,
and twenty-four for pistols. The quantity of powder
they contain respectively is, for wall pieces ten drachms,
musket six, carbine four, and pistol three drachms.</p>

<p>Blank cartridges, for pistols, carbines, and muskets, are
made of blue paper, to preserve a distinction between ball
and blank, and to prevent the possibility of accidents, from
the ball cartridges being mixed with the blank.</p>

<p>The charge for muskets is commonly half the weight of
the ball. The balls for musketry are eighteen to the pound;
and one pound of powder is sufficient for thirty-six cartridges.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
Forty cartridges may be used to the pound, but forty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
would be too weak. The paper, necessary to form cartridges,
should be well sized and not too thick. It is made
for the purpose, under the name of cartridge paper, and
should be of such a size as to cut to advantage. It is usually
fourteen inches in length, and sixteen in breadth. A sheet
will form twelve cartridges, but on account of wastage, it
makes only ten. Half a sheet is employed as a wrapper for
every ten cartridges, and one and a half sheets are used for
ten and their wrapper. Six quires will make 1000 cartridges,
and 31 reams, 100,000. Five ounces of packthread are necessary
for binding 1000 cartridges, and 31 lbs. for 100,000.</p>

<p>Musket cartridges are made in the following manner.
Long tables are provided, and, at certain distances, excavations,
or holes are made, larger than the diameter of the
ball, and one-third of its diameter in depth. These holes are
designed for rounding the folds upon the ball. It is necessary
first to be provided with formers to roll the cartridges
upon, and measures to fill them with. These formers are
made of hard and dry wood, seven inches, or seven and a
half inches in length, and six-tenths of an inch in diameter,
one-twelfth of an inch less than the diameter of the caliber.
One end is rounded so as not to hurt the hand; the other is
hollow, to receive one-third of the ball. The measures are
in the form of the frustrum of a cone, open above. They are
made of sheet-tin, and should contain one-fortieth part of a
pound of powder, (one-forty-ninth according to the Strasburgh
directions), or, when heaped, one thirty-sixth part of
a pound. The height of these measures is one inch and a
quarter; their diameter at the large end one inch and one-twelfth,
and at the smaller end, three-quarters of an inch. In
every squad of ten men, six are employed to roll the cartridges,
two to fill them, and two to pack them. Each squad
may make 10,000, but commonly 8,000, in a day.</p>

<p>To cut the paper for musket cartridges, we begin by folding
the sheet in three parts widthwise; then each third part
into two, again into three, and again into two, by a diagonal
line which takes from 2.2 inches of a superior angle on the
left, to 2.2 of the opposite inferior angle at the right; so that
every sheet of paper will cut, without loss, into twelve parts,
and every part will be 5.68 inches in height, 4.53 in width
at one end, and 2.2 at the other end. According to Bigot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
however, each trapezoid thus formed is 5<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span> inches in length,
4<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> in width at one end, and 2<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> at the other end. The
paper is cut by a person detailed for the purpose.</p>

<p>The person who rolls the cartridges, having spread the
cut paper upon a table, takes the form with one hand, and
the ball in the other, which he puts into the hollow of the
form; after which, he rolls the paper round the ball and the
form, so that there remains sufficient beyond the ball, to fold
over in small folds; then he rolls the form surrounded with
the paper, and having rounded the folds upon the ball, in a
small hole made for that purpose in the table, he withdraws
the form, and passes the cartridge to the man who is to fill
it. He puts in the charge with a small tin measure, folds the
paper over upon the powder as close as possible, and passes
it on to him who is to make the packages. The packer takes
ten in his hand, and arranges them on a sheet of paper folded
in two, the balls half on one side and half on the other; and
having wrapped them in the paper, he folds over the two
ends, and ties the packets crosswise over the middle, and
lengthwise.</p>

<p>Musket cartridges cannot be too tightly rolled upon the
form; and to ascertain their accuracy, they must be calibered
before they are loaded; that is, they must be put into the
end of a musket. He who fills them, should make a charge
complete in every cartridge, and not load one more than another,
but always pour a full measure into every one. The
packer should tie the cartridges, and round them as much
as possible, without tearing the paper. He should take care
that all the packets are of the same length; so that they may
be placed in the partitions of the ammunition chest, which
are all of one determined length, and will not therefore contain
them, if made too long.</p>

<p>Cannon cartouches should be well arranged in the ammunition
chests, and well stowed with tow, that they may be
carried without danger of injury from the road. The tow
is pressed down in small quantities, by a little wooden spatula,
and cannot be pressed too hard; for the more the chests
are stuffed with tow, the better the ammunition will be preserved.</p>

<p>Musket cartridges are placed in the ammunition chests in
different arrangements, the height of which is proportioned
to that of the cartridge. There are three stories in height in
each chest, for musket cartridges; and between each a small
separation, to prevent them from injuring each other. The
number of cartridges contained in an ammunition wagon is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
proportioned to the kind of wagon in use, and to the quantity
necessary for the service. The common load of ammunition
wagons does not exceed thirteen hundred weight, if it
is meant to take the benefit of forced marches. In every ammunition
wagon for cannon cartouches, there are cartouches
with ball, grape-shot, quick-match, and port-fires, staffs for
port-fires, priming wires and match-rope&mdash;so that every wagon
contains all kinds of ammunition relative to its caliber.
In an ammunition wagon filled with musket cartridges, a certain
number of flints are contained, to be distributed to the
troops from the same chest whence they receive their ammunition.</p>

<p>We might here speak of the load of every ammunition wagon;
but this subject more particularly belongs to artillery
and its suite, than to fire-works.</p>

<p>Cartridges, used in sieges, &amp;c. are made of paper bags, of
the calibers of the different pieces, and of a sufficient length
to contain the requisite quantity of powder. The paper should
be large and strong.</p>

<p>The handle of each of the formers should have such a
length and size, as to render them convenient to hold in the
hand. Care must be taken to pierce a small hole in the middle,
through the whole length of the form, by which the air
might enter to the cartouches, and cause the form to be
more easily drawn out, after the cartridge is made.</p>

<p>Pasted cartridges are formed in the usual manner upon a
former; and when five-sixths of the paper are rolled, the remaining
portion is pasted with a paste made of flour and
glue, mixed together. The bottom is pasted over in the same
manner. When the cartridge is drawn off the former, it is
placed to dry in the sun, or near a stove.</p>

<p>With regard to the cost of cartridges in France, it appears,
that a pound of packthread costs twelve sous, and
workmen receive from fifteen to twenty sous per thousand
for their labour. The whole expense of 100,000 would be,
for paper, 105 livres; for packthread, 18 livres, 15 sous; for
making 100 livres; total 223 livres, 15 sous. Bigot has furnished
us with the following estimate:</p>

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. II. Of Cannon Cartridges.</i></p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gargousse</i> of the French, in artillery, is a sack or bag
of paper, or parchment, destined to enclose the load of a
cannon. When it is made of serge, it is then called a pouch,
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sachet</i>); and, when united with the ball, it receives the
name of ball-cartridge.</p>

<p>Bigot remarks, that these cartridges have been substituted
for the dangerous and unsafe use of the spoon, or ladle,
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lanternes</i>, Fr.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>), by means of which the load was carried to
the bottom of the piece. They are paper bags or sacks, of
the caliber of the gun. The loading is much more expeditious,
and less danger is to be apprehended. It requires
only, that the piece should be well sponged, and the priming
to communicate with the load.</p>

<p>For the construction of these cases, coarse gray paper, and
sufficiently strong, is used; and they should be well pasted.
The paper, which is used with advantage, and commonly
employed, is 23 inches in length, and 28 inches in breadth.
It serves for all calibers, and even proof charges, which are
stronger than the ordinary loads. The paper is cut of such a
size as to leave from 1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inches, to 1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches, on the roller, and
a sufficiency to cover the lower extremity. One of the sides,
as well as the side which is cut, is pasted. The paper is
rolled upon the former, or roller, and is straightened, so
that the hand may be passed over the pasted part, and the
paper tightened. The bottom of the bag is placed upon the
roller, and, in folding it, the bag is tied above that part of
the paper, which is pasted. The bag is then dried, by
placing it on one end upon a table, and exposing it to the
air.</p>

<p>The rollers should be bored in their axis, so that, in drawing
them out, they may come out easy, and without injuring
the bag. This hole admits the external air, and prevents the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
formation of a vacuum in a degree, when the roller is suddenly
withdrawn. The bottoms (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">culots</i>,) are cut of the same
diameter as the roller. The paste is made of flour and glue.</p>

<p>The table given by Bigot, p. 28, relative to the dimensions
of sacks or cartridges, for cannon, embraces the following
particulars: The diameter of the former, or roller for a
24 pr. is 5<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub></span> inches: for a 16, 4<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>; for a 12, 4; for an 8, 3<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>;
for a 6, 3<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub></span>; and for a four pounder 2<span class="xs"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> of an inch: the circumference
of the cartridge for a 24 pr. is 17<span class="xs"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span> inches; for a
16, 15<span class="xs"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>ths; for a 12, 13<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span>; for an 8, 12<span class="xs"><sup>11</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>; for a 6, 6<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>; for a
4, 9<span class="xs"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span>ds inches. The height of the roller for a 24 pr. is 18
inches; for a 16, 15; for a 12, 14; for an 8, 13; for a 6, 12<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>,
and for a 4, 12. The height of the paper, including the circumference,
for a 24 pr. is 17<span class="xs"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span> inches; for a 16, 14; for a 12, 14;
for an 8, 11; for a 6, 10<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>; for a 4, 10. The height, which covers
the cartridge, is for a 24 pr. 1<span class="xs"><sup>5</sup>/<sub>10</sub></span> inches; for a 16, 1<span class="xs"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>; for a
12, 1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>; for an 8, <span class="xs"><sup>11</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>; for a 6, <span class="xs"><sup>10</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>; and for a 4, <span class="xs"><sup>9</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>. The bottom
(<i>culot</i>,) for a 24 pr. is 1<span class="xs"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>th inches; for a 16, 1; for a
12, <span class="xs"><sup>10</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>; for an 8, <span class="xs"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span>ds; for a 6, <span class="xs"><sup>7</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>; and for a 4, <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inch. The
height of the charge for a 24 pr. is 11<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub></span> for a 16, 8<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>; for a 12,
8<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub></span>; for an 8, 7<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span>; for a 6, 6<span class="xs"><sup>9</sup>/<sub>11</sub></span>; and for a 4, 6<span class="xs"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>ths inches.
The height of the paper, for the charges of exercise, is for a
24 pr. 10 inches; for a 16, 9; for a 12, 8; for an 8, 7; for a
6, 6<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>; and for a 4, 6 inches.</p>

<p>In the table of the proportions of the charge, for different
calibers, given by Ruggieri, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pyrotechnie Militaire</cite>, p. 197,)
besides the weight of the ball, and the height of the sack, the
weight of the charge is given in pounds, and ounces, which
is thus stated by him: for a 4 pr. 1 lb. 8 oz; an 8 pr. 2 lbs.
8 oz; a 12 pr. 4 lbs. 8 oz; a 16 pr. 5 lbs; and a 24 pr. 8 lbs.</p>

<p><i>Cannon Cartouches</i> are composed of a bag of serge, and a
shoe or base, in which the ball was fixed by means of a tin
cross, nailed to the shoe or base. The bag should be as large
as the shoe, and long enough to contain the requisite quantity
of powder. The shoe is a little less in diameter than
the ball, so that the tin and the bag put upon it, do not increase
its size beyond that of the ball. The shoe is flat on
one side, and hollow on the other. The hollow part should be
a spherical concavity, about one-third of the diameter of the
ball. At a small distance from the bottom of the shoe, a
groove is made sufficiently deep to contain the packthread,
with which it is fastened to the bag.</p>

<p>In the construction of cannon cartouches, the ball must
first be fixed to the base by means of two tin bands in the
form of a cross, and nailed with two small nails at the bot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>tom
and sides of the base. These bands for sixteen and
twelve pounders, are at least .44 decimal parts of an inch in
width, and 15 inches long. Those for eight and four pounders,
are .355 decimal parts of an inch in width, and 11.72
inches in length.</p>

<p>The ball being fixed on this base, it is put into a bag filled
with powder, and the bag tied above to the base. Then a
bit of parchment soaked in water, of from two to four inches
in width, and of sufficient length to go round the cartouch,
is placed round the bag, half on the shoe and half on the
powder. Then tie it with a string passing in the groove, at
about .27 parts of an inch below the base; so that the cartouch
is tied in three different places&mdash;the two first above in
the groove of the shoe, serves to hold the bag and it strongly
together; the third below, is to prevent the powder from
rising and slipping between the bag and the shoe. The
band is placed on the part where the greatest friction is, to
preserve the bag from being torn.</p>

<p>The cartouch thus made, is to be calibered by trying it
with the piece for which it is intended, into which it must
enter with ease. This cannot be too strongly recommended.
It is of all things the most essential, and the only way of ascertaining
the goodness of ammunition.</p>

<p>A workshop of twelve workmen is divided into four classes.
The first class consists of two men who put the ball into the
shoe; the second of two others who fill the bag with powder;
the third, two others who press the powder into the bag;
and the remaining six are employed in tying the bags to the
shoes, two to each.</p>

<p>These twelve workmen can, in one day of twelve hours,
make two hundred and forty cartouches, of sixteen or twelve
pounders, or 320 of eight or four pounders.</p>

<p class="p1">To make <i>grape shot</i>, we must have a bag of ticking, in
which the small balls are arranged; also a shoe, to which not
only the bag which contains the ball is attached, but also the
serge filled with powder.</p>

<p>The shoe is made of the same wood with the ball cartridges,
and of the following dimensions, viz. The sixteen
pounder should have 4.97 inches diameter; the twelve pounders,
4.35; the eight pounders, 3.82; and the four pounders, 3.1
inches diameter. Those of the caliber of sixteen and twelve,
should be 1.6 inches in thickness, with a groove in the middle
of .44 parts of an inch in depth, and the same in width; the
eight and four pounders have but 1.07 inch in thickness, with
a groove in the middle of .36 parts of an inch in depth and
width. Every shoe or base, has a pin in its centre, the size
of which is in proportion to the vacancy left by the small
balls of iron arranged about it. The height is in proportion
to the different layers of ball.&mdash;In general thirty-six balls are
put into one grape shot, of whatever caliber it be; that is to
say, six heights of six each. The balls should be proportioned
to the caliber, so that the six balls on the base should
exactly fill the circumference of it. The pin in the middle of
the base is exactly the size of the ball and seven times its
diameter in height. At the top of the pin a groove is made
to tie the threads, the width of which is one-third, and the
depth, one-fourth of its diameter.</p>

<p>The bag in which the small balls are arranged, layer upon
layer, should be of good strong ticking closely woven. It is of
the size of the shot, and 2.13 inches in length above the top of
the pin. It is strongly fastened at the bottom in the groove of
the base with strong pack-thread. There must be 3<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> fathom
of strong pack-thread trebled, to tie the grape of the caliber
of sixteen and twelve pounders, and three fathom only for
one of eight and four.</p>

<p>Grape shot may be corded in the same manner as the
carcase is corded; with this difference, instead of eight turns,
taking only six. The best and strongest method of tying
the thread in grape-shot, is in the net-work form&mdash;one person
holding, and another tying it.</p>

<p>In a work-shop where ten men are employed, eight are employed
to wind the thread round, and two to attach the bag
to the base or shoe, or to arrange the small balls on the shoe,
round the pin. Such a work-shop, in a day of ten hours, can
complete 120 grape-shot of the largest caliber, and as many
as 140 of eight or four pounders might be made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">OF MATCHES.</p>


<p>Matches, in artillery, are a kind of rope made of flax,
hemp, or cotton slightly twisted, and prepared to retain fire
for the use of artillery, mines, fire-works, &amp;c. Bigot, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité
d'Artifice de Guerre</cite>, p. 64,) has considered this subject under
three heads; namely, of match-rope, priming fuses or tubes,
and quick-match. We purpose, therefore, in the following
sections, to treat the subject in this order.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. I. Of Slow Match.</i></p>

<p>Slow-match may be prepared by different processes.
When hemp or tow is spun on the wheel like cord, but very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
slack, and made into three twists and then covered with tow,
so that the twists do not appear, and then boiled in the lees of
old wine, a slow-match will be formed which burns very
gradually; but slow-match is commonly made after the following
method: The rope for this match is made of flax, or
of soft well-beaten hemp, thoroughly cleansed from the harder
fibres, and the strands are loosely spun. Three strands
are sufficient, which should not, when formed into rope,
exceed one inch and two-thirds in thickness. It should not
be shortened in twisting more than one-fifth, or one-fourth
at most, in order to be firm without being hard.</p>

<p>The ley or lixivium in which the rope is soaked, is composed
of wood ashes and quick lime; and every hundred
pounds of match require fifty pounds of the former, and
twenty-five pounds of the latter. They are boiled for fifteen
hours and are taken out of the tub, piled in heaps and covered
with tow, in which situation they are left to ferment.
Some recommend, in order to improve them, immersing them
two or three times in a nitrous solution, composed of four
pounds of saltpetre in a sufficient quantity of water, to every
one hundred pounds of match.</p>

<p>The match is afterwards polished by rubbing it along a
hair rope, which removes all extraneous fibres that would
spread fire too rapidly. Twisting the rope strongly before
it is polished, is said to be a good plan.</p>

<p>Matches are finally dried in the sun, and rolled into
pieces of twenty yards each, (weighing about two and a half
pounds); then made up into barrels or boxes, each of which
contains about twenty of these pieces. Match of a good
quality burns uniformly at the rate of five inches per hour,
and its coal terminates in a point that resists pressure.
Match rope may be formed by boiling the rope in water,
containing three pounds of wood ashes, one pound of quicklime,
two pounds of the liquor of horse-dung, and one
pound of saltpetre.</p>

<p>In the small work, called <cite>The Bombardier and Pocket
Gunner</cite>, there are three formulæ given for slow-match: The
first consists in soaking light twisted rope in strong ley for
three days. It burns three feet in six hours. The second or
No. 2, as made at Gibraltar, by immersing blue paper in a
solution of eight ounces of nitre in a gallon of water. The
No. 3, by soaking rope in a solution of three-fourths of an

quantity in the same proportion, according to the rope.</p>

<p>The use of the acetate or sugar of lead for the formation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
of match-rope, was recommended by a French officer in
1782; and since that time has been used in France both with
and without saltpetre. The tinder-wood, if soaked alternately
in solutions of saltpetre and sugar of lead, will form a very
good match.</p>

<p>M. Rothelet (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives des Découvertes</cite>, v, p. 239) has given
some new observations on the use of acetate of lead for
the preparation of combustible match-rope. He mentions the
use of liquid acetate of lead, which may either be a solution
of the oxide of lead in distilled vinegar, or a solution of sugar
of lead in water. Rope, he adds, may be made very inflammable,
by soaking it well in the liquid acetate, and drying
it thoroughly. See also the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bulletin de Pharmacie</cite>, September,
1812.</p>

<p>Matches may be made very expeditiously by employing
sugar of lead in the following manner: Put a quantity of
rain or river water in a kettle over the fire, and when it
boils, throw in sugar of lead in the proportion of three-fourths
of an ounce to a pound of water. Remove the kettle when
the sugar of lead is all dissolved, and immerse the cord or
rope in the solution for ten minutes, and then take it out and
dry it in the air. If cold water is used, the rope must remain
longer in the solution. Rope of every description,
old or new, or that made of the linden bark, and damaged
match, may be submitted to the same process, previously
boiling them in common water to remove their old coating.
One pound of solution is required for each pound of cord.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Ruggeri (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pyrotechnie Militaire</cite>, p. 185,) has a similar
process. The <i>salt of saturn</i> there recommended, is the same
as sugar of lead.</p>

<p>When matches have been made by contract, we may determine
their quality by examining their interior, to see if they
are not mixed with old matches, or pieces of dirty hemp.
They should be sufficiently closed without being either too
hard or too loose. The lixivium should penetrate to their
centre; the difference of colour will indicate the contrary.
They should be well dried and partake neither of mould nor
rottenness, which are easily ascertained by the colour and
smell. To be good, the match when lighted should preserve
the fire, and burn uniformly without interruption in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
moist weather, so that a piece of five inches in length shall
last at least one hour.</p>

<p>In 1808, there appeared in our papers an article on the
subject of <i>artillery rods</i>, of which the following is a copy.
We re-published it in the Aurora, of Philadelphia, in the
same year, with comments. Instead of the acetate, nitrate
of lead is used.</p>

<p>M. Cadet, of Paris, has invented artillery rods to supersede
the matches in common use. They may be made of
birch, elm, poplar, or of the linden tree. They are saturated
with nitrate of lead and undergo two ebullitions in spirit
of turpentine. They then burn very well and are not extinguished
by the air. A <i>metre</i> of each will last an hour and a half,
while the common matches burn only seven minutes. General
Gassendi has made a calculation, which proves, that
matches, which now cost the French government twenty-thousand
livres, will not cost more than fifteen hundred, if
made on M. C's new principle.</p>

<p>One pound of rope-match, such as is used in the military
academy of Segovia, lasts nearly thirty-five hours, and rather
more provided it be damp. In that state it is generally
surcharged with from six to seven per cent. of moisture. In
short it would be better to dry the rods in an oven, before
they are saturated with the nitrate as well as afterwards.
The following table shows the difference of duration between
the matches made of rope and the new invented rods; and
the quantity of nitrate, each wood absorbs per quintal, is
specified in the last column.</p>

<p class="p1">Hence we find that the poplar, pine, cedar and willow, exclude
themselves when compared with the linden tree; since
they absorb three or four times more nitrate than the latter,
without burning longer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span></p>

<p>The linden unites the advantages of economy and duration,
since it absorbs only a tenth of its weight. The common
oak, elm, walnut and green oak, occupy but the second
rank. We may remark also, that the hardest woods are not
of the greatest duration; for a rod made of green oak, which
is much harder than the common oak, supports combustion
only eight hours, while the latter will burn for twelve hours.
Half a <i>kilogramme</i> of nitrate of lead will saturate forty-five
<i>metres</i> of elm, seventeen of birch; twenty-one of poplar, and
twelve of the linden tree. The woods were cut in <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'parallelopepids'">parallelepipeds</ins>
and boiled in a fish-pan.</p>

<p>MM. Carnot, Guyton Morveau, and Deyeux, were appointed
to examine this invention, who reported favorably.
An extract of their report may be seen in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives des
Découvertes</cite>, v, p. 240.</p>

<p>Born also recommends for the same purpose, nitrate of
lead, and used in the same manner. Proust, it appears, repeated
the experiments of Born, and came to the same conclusion;&mdash;that
it was an expeditious, and, on a large scale, an
economical process for making matches. Proust, however,
used hazle wood. He observes that the solution must be
strong; that when cold it requires three days immersion in
the fluid, and when boiling, only one and a half hours. He
also found that nitrate of copper may be substituted for either
the acetate or nitrate of lead.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. II. Of Priming Tubes.</i></p>

<p>Priming tubes, (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fusées d'amorce</i>) serve to communicate
fire to the powder in a cannon. They were formerly made
of tin, but in consequence of the inconvenience of rusting
they were laid aside. James (<cite>Military Dictionary</cite>, p. 416)
remarks, that, owing to this defect in the tin, a colonel Harding
had invented a pewter tube in lieu of tin tubes. Tubes
are used in quick firing. When made of tin their diameter
is two-tenths of an inch, being just sufficient to enter into the
vent of the piece. They are about six inches long. Through
this tube is drawn a quick-match, the cap being primed with
meal powder moistened with spirits of wine. To prevent
the mealed powder from falling out by carriage, a cap of paper
or flannel, steeped in spirits of wine, is tied over it.</p>

<p>They are composed of two distinct parts, the <i>cravat</i> which
contains the priming, and the tube that enters into the
touch hole. Small pieces of well dried reeds or of quills, a
little less than the size of the vent of the piece, are preferred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
They are made thus. The reeds are cut into pieces three
inches in length, square at one end and diagonally at the
other, and are passed through a caliber two and one-third
lines in diameter, (the diameter of the vent being two and
one-fourth lines;) they are then rubbed clean in the inside by
passing a small file several times through them, that removes
the inner skin. Having prepared the reeds, they are filled,
and also quills, or other cases, with the composition hereafter
mentioned, made sufficiently thin to enter them. This
may be done with the most facility by placing the cases side
by side, with the square end up, in a tin or wooden box five
inches deep; the composition is put into this, and made to
descend into the cases, by knocking the box on the table.
When they are full, they are taken out of the box, wiped
clean, and laid to dry in the sun or in a warm room; before
the composition is entirely dry, a knitting needle is passed
from one end to the other, in order that the fire may reach
the bore of the piece more rapidly. The match of communication
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">etoupille</i>) is then fixed. This is done by cutting a
notch on each side of the reed, near the end that is cut
square, to which two strands of a match, two and a half
inches long, are tied with a fibre of hemp.</p>

<p>The tubes are tied up in packets of ten each, to facilitate
their distribution in service.</p>

<p>The reeds, or other cases, may also be filled in the following
way, <i>viz</i>: Take twine made of the strands of cotton
thread, and cut into pieces ten inches long; fold each of these
into two lengths, and pass them through the reed from one
end to the other by means of a loop of very fine thread. The
two inches are covered with some of the composition made
thick.</p>

<p class="p1">The composition is to be moistened with a solution of
camphor, &amp;c. in brandy. To every pint add one ounce of
gum arabic, and half an ounce of camphor. Gum water
retards the combustion of the match.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span></p>

<p>Fifteen pounds of this composition will make ten thousand
tubes.</p>

<p>M. Cadet, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives des Découvertes</cite>, i, p. 412) has connected
with the match a preparation of chlorate of potassa, which is
inflamed by sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>We have already spoken of the use of chlorate, formerly
called hyper-oxymuriate, of potassa, in this way. See <a href="#CLPx"><i>chlorate
of potassa</i>.</a></p>

<p>M. Cadet's invention is as follows: In a glass tube or tube
of elder, is enclosed a match covered with a mixture of
chlorate of potassa and sulphur; above which is fixed a small
glass bulb containing sulphuric acid. This bulb has a small
stem of glass similar to that of the candle cracker, to stick it by
into the composition. This match is placed above the vent
or touch hole, and retained there by a socket of lead. A
spring, to which a small hammer is attached, is fixed to the
gun, and is extended and kept in that position by a hook or
bolt. When this is pushed, the spring is unhooked, and by
recovering itself gives a blow with the hammer which
breaks the glass ball, and the acid falls directly on the composition.
This is then inflamed and the fire is communicated
to the match, and from the match to the gunpowder.</p>

<p>A small portion of sugar mixed with the chlorate of potassa
and sulphur, will ensure the composition to inflame
with more certainty; although M. Cadet mentions only the
hyper-oxymuriate and sulphur. If some of this composition,
after the priming fuse is charged, be put in the cup of the
fuse, a drop of sulphuric acid will inflame the fuse.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. III. Of Quick Matches.</i></p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">etoupille</i> of the French is the same as quick match,
which is used to communicate fire in particular in military
works, to priming tubes and other fuses. We have noticed
in a former article the preparation of the matches of communication
used in Fire-works, and the mode of forming leaders
for the purpose of conveying fire to the different parts of
a fixed or moveable piece. It will be sufficient, therefore, to
notice the preparation of what is usually called quick match.
These matches are made, according to Bigot, of five strands
of fine cotton thread, soaked twenty-four hours in strong vinegar,
and sometimes in brandy. They are then put, for
twelve hours at least, in a liquid paste, made of meal gunpowder,
and spirits, in which gum arabic and camphor are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
dissolved, in proportions to be given hereafter. To make
them imbibe this completely, they are pressed with a pallet
knife. They are then taken out and drawn gently between
the fingers to discharge the excess, spread upon a table, and
when half dry, dusted with meal-powder. The match is
rolled by hand to make it round, hung upon a frame, furnished
with pins, to dry, and afterwards cut into lengths of
two and a half feet and tied up in bundles.</p>

<p class="center"><a name="PORx" id="PORx"></a>OF PORT FIRES.</p>


<p>Port fires (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lances à feu</i>) are a species of fuse of a slow composition,
designed for different purposes, and particularly for
guns, when they are to fire rapidly. The paper, is first rolled
in cases. The rod or mandril should be of hard wood, 16
or 18 inches long, and 5<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> lines in diameter. Two brass
rods to load them, one of 17 inches in length, the other of
only 8, are required. A wooden rammer, with a heavy head,
may be used. A small funnel with a spout 5<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> lines in diameter,
and a ladle to lift the composition, are also required.
The instructions of M. Bigot for the formation of <i>Port-fire</i>
are that the paper must be cut in bands, 3<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> to four inches
wide, and 15 inches long, and six strips of this paper are to
be arranged on a level table, one above the other in such a
way, that each strip extends about half an inch beyond the next
below it, and pasting the projecting parts of it; that the wooden
rod is then placed upon the upper strip, near the side, and
the paper is rolled several times round it; pressing it at the
same time, and shutting the case, thus formed, at one end,
by bending the paper up 3 or 4 lines on the rod, and striking
it on the table to flatten it; that the rod is then removed, and
the case is dried, which is afterwards filled by introducing
the composition through the funnel, and ramming it as fast as
it falls down; which is done by alternately raising and lowering
the copper rod, without drawing it entirely out; that in
charging, care must be taken to beat it uniformly, with such
a force, that the paper may not be torn, and the composition
equally solid throughout; that when the composition is within
an inch of the end of the paper case, a tow match is put
over it, of 1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches in circumference, the two ends of
which project from the paper case, and are covered with priming
paste; and finally, that the port-fire is finished, by pasting
upon its end a small bit of paper, which is torn off, when
the match is to be used.</p>

<p>Port-fires are tied up in a sheet of paper, in parcels of ten.</p>

<p class="p1">The articles are pulverized, and mixed by passing them
through fine sieves at least twice. After the addition of linseed
oil, the composition is again mixed with the hand. If
too much oil be added, the port-fire will not keep. Fourteen
pounds of composition, and 2<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> reams of paper, are
required for 100 port-fires.</p>

<p>Port-fires are usually 16<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches, and seldom more than
21 inches in length. The paper cases must be rolled, wet
with paste. The distinction, made between what is called
the wet, and dry port-fire, is, that, in the former, linseed oil
is used, and, in the latter, the composition is mixed dry.
Dry port-fire, according to the British formula, is composed of
saltpetre 4 parts, sulphur 1, meal-powder 2, and antimony 1.</p>

<p class="center"><a name="FUSx" id="FUSx"></a>OF FUSES FOR SHELLS, HOWITZES, AND
GRENADES.</p>


<p>The fusée of the French, is applied to various purposes,
and is differently made by different artificers. Fuses are intended
to communicate fire to the powder with which shells,
&amp;c. are filled, so as to make them burst in the places to
which they are thrown. They are composed, according to
some, of one pound of gunpowder, and two or three ounces
of charcoal, well mixed together; or of four pounds of gunpowder,
two of saltpetre, and one of sulphur. It is to be
remarked that the time a bomb, or grenade, will take to burn,
after it has been thrown out of the mortar, or a howitz out
of a howitzer, depends entirely upon the length and quality
of the fuse. Fuses are made of wood turned in the form of
a truncated cone, in order to enter fairly into the <i>eye</i> of the
shell. They are perforated through the middle, in the direction
of the axis, so as to receive the composition. This
channel is called the <i>light</i> of the fuse. The wood that is
employed, should be strong, dry, sound, and without knots.
The best kinds are the oak, the elm, and the linden. They
are filled with a slow combustible composition. The materials
are increased or diminished according to the nature of
their application. Fuses are sometimes made of copper.</p>

<p>The fuses for 10 and 12 inch shells are 8<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches long;
for 8 inch shells, 7<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>, for howitzes, 5<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>; and for hand
grenades, 2<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>. The diameter of the light, in the first is 5
lines, in the second and third, 4 lines, and 2 lines for grenades.
At the larger end of the fuse for shells, and howitzes,
a cup is made from 10 to 14 lines in diameter, and 3 deep.
In turning them, a solid bit, 2<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches thick, is left at the
small end, to prevent them from splitting, when the composition
is pressed into the canal. When the fuse is to be driven
into the eye of the projectile, this piece is sawn off, cutting
the fuse diagonally. The turner marks its termination by a
circle upon the fuse. Fuses decrease nearly one inch in
length, and two lines in diameter, according to the caliber of
the bomb. The diameter of the lights, or apertures, only
diminish half a line.</p>

<p>In what is called the Shrapnel shell, invented by colonel
Shrapnel, the seasonable use of the fuse constitutes one of its
principal advantages. With regard to the American elonga<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>ted
shell, invented by a gentleman in the Ordnance, we have
heard nothing. See <a href="#SHRx"><i>Shrapnel shell</i></a>, &amp;c.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. I. Of the Method of Charging the Fuses of Bombs or
Shells.</i></p>

<p>Two rammers of copper are required for each of the several
calibers of 12, 10, and 8 inches; the first an inch longer
than the fuse, the second half as long. These rammers are
of the same size with the lights of their respective fuses, and
have a head to receive the blows of a mallet. Only one rod
is wanted for the fuses of smaller calibers.</p>

<p>The first operation is to examine the fuses, to see that they
have no knots or flaws, and are not wormeaten. The artificers
place themselves astride, and facing each other, upon benches
of strong plank, having, between them, a small vessel filled with
the composition, and each one, a small measure. Each artificer
takes a fuse, inserts the small end into a hole, made in the
bench, for the purpose of maintaining it erect, and preventing
it from splitting in the act of charging. He then passes a
measure of the composition into the light, and introduces the
first rod, on which he strikes 15 strokes, of equal force, with
the mallet. Between every three strokes, he raises the rod,
to make the composition fall. The ramming of this measure
is therefore executed in 5 <i>vollies</i> or blows. He then withdraws
the rod, and introduces a new charge of the composition,
which he beats as before, and so on until the fuse is
half full; after which he makes use of the second rod, and
goes on loading, until the charge reaches within three lines
of the cup. He then takes two strands of quick match, which
(after placing them in the form of a cross, on the top of the
fuse) he presses with his rod, pours some of the composition
upon them, and, beating it carefully so as not to cut the
match, he fills the fuse to the top of the cup.</p>

<p>The fuses of howitzes and grenades are charged in the
same way; but the blows are not so heavy as in larger ones,
for fear of splitting the wood.</p>

<p>The fuses being thus charged, the quick match is folded
into the cup, and the opening closed with a bit of cloth or
parchment, or very strong paper, which is tied an inch below
the top. This operation is called <i>capping</i> the fuse. All the
fuses for bombs or grenades are at present furnished with
matches. Care must be taken, therefore, to leave a vacancy
of about .27 parts of an inch, in order to fix in the match.
Fuses of grenades are charged with the same precision as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
those for bombs, only the blows, as we remarked, should be
weaker for fear of splitting the fuse. Before the little end is
driven into the bomb or shell, care is to be taken to have the
end cut slopingly, without which the communication of the
fire with the powder would be uncertain.</p>

<p>When fuses have been well loaded, and the materials previously
well mixed, they will naturally burn with an equal
steady fire, preserving in general an even length of flame,
without splitting, or irregularly shaking. They may be proved
by throwing them into water, tied to a stone, or by driving
them with heavy blows into the earth. They should not go
out in either of these cases. Fuses made with the composition
we shall describe, and for 10 and 12 inch shells, last
seventy seconds. According to the Strasbourg directions,
it appears, that fuses for shells of 12.78 inches should last
until you can count 80 or 85, or 70 seconds. Those for bombs
8.52 inches, 65 counts, or 60 seconds, and those for grenades
25 or 30 counts.</p>

<p>Before the fuse is driven into the bomb, the thin or small
end must be cut off, in order that the fire may be easily communicated
to the mass of gunpowder, which is lodged in the
bomb. To fire bombs at a small distance, the fuse must be
cut on a longer slant, so that the bomb may take effect sooner,
and may not remain a long time in the place where it falls,
without bursting.</p>

<p>The fuse must be of such a length, as to continue burning
all the time the shell is in its range, and to set fire to the
powder as soon as it touches the ground, which occasions the
shell instantly to burst into many pieces. When the distance
from the object is known, the time of the shell's flight
may be computed to a second or two; which being ascertained,
the fuse may be cut accordingly. By burning two or
three, and making use of a watch, or of a string, by way of
a pendulum, to vibrate seconds, we may determine the length
of time a fuse, or any length of a fuse, will take to burn.</p>

<p>In order to preserve fuses for a length of time, and protect
them from moisture, the cap is coated with a composition,
or cement, made of 16 parts of bees' wax, and 4 of mutton
tallow; melting the wax first, and then adding the suet.
Some make use of two-thirds wax, and one-third rosin. The
cap of the fuse is dipped in, when the mixture is half cold,
and immediately withdrawn.</p>

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. II. Of Loading Shells, Howitzes and Grenades.</i></p>

<p>The shells, before they are loaded, are cleansed from any
foreign substances that may be in them; and those which are
split, or have flaws in the eye are rejected; so are also those
that are not well bored, or are eccentric. They are then
charged with powder, introduced into them by means of a
funnel. Five or six pounds of gunpowder are usually put
into twelve-inch shells; from three to five, in ten-inch shells;
from one to one and a quarter, into eight-inch shells; from
three-quarters to one pound, into howitzes; and grenades
of all sorts are half filled. The charge of shells is increased,
when they are to burst into a great number of pieces; for
instance, when they are to fall among troops. Incendiary
fire-works are added, when buildings are to be set on fire.
Among these are fire-stone, and incendiary matches.</p>

<p>The charge having been put into these hollow projectiles,
a fuse is introduced into the eye, after it has been cut diagonally
at the smaller end, and the smaller part taken off. It is
forced in by repeated blows of a mallet on the fuse driver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
which is laid upon the cap of the fuse. It ought not to project
more than eight or ten lines in shells, and six or seven
in howitzes.</p>

<p>The fuses of loaded shells, howitzes, and grenades are
preserved from wet and fire in the field, by dipping that part
of the fuse, which projects from the surface of the sphere,
for the same purpose as before mentioned, into the following
composition. The immersion must be made, when the composition,
after being melted, is half cold. Either this, or
the formula before given, may be used.</p>

<p class="p1">Agreeably to the Strasbourg Memoir on Military Fire-works,
it appears, that, fuses being driven into the shell, four
threads of match must be neatly arranged in the cap. Then
cap the fuse with a piece of parchment dipped in brandy;
after which, apply round the fuse, at the eye of the shell,
some capping wax when lukewarm. Then dip all the extreme
part of the fuse, down to the shell, in melted pitch,
which you will leave to cool in the shade, in such a manner,
that the shell may neither be exposed to moisture, nor to the
accident of fire.</p>

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. III. Of Fuses with Dead Light.</i></p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feu mort</i>, or dead fire fuse, is a peculiar species of
fuse. The difference, between these fuses and the ordinary
kind, consists in this, that the eye, instead of being pierced
and hollow, is full, and of a hemispherical shape. In both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
cases, however, the composition is introduced through the
small end.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Composition for dead light.</i></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl wd70">Meal-gunpowder,</td><td class="tdc wd5">16</td><td class="tdc wd7">&nbsp;parts.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Ashes of wood,</td><td class="tdc">9½</td><td class="tdc">&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="p1">The ashes must be dried, and run through a sieve. Potters'
earth, or clay, will produce the same effect as the ashes.</p>

<p>In proceeding to charge a bomb-fuse that is made of ordinary
wood, the eye, or aperture, is first closed with pipe
clay, which is well beaten and pressed against the fuse in a
small platter; the thin end of the fuse being held upwards.
Three lines (<span class="xs"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span>ths of an inch) of this earth will be sufficient
to stop the communication of any fire. A tube, or trundle,
filled with meal-powder, for the purpose of setting fire to
the composition called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feu mort</i>, is thrust into the fuse, by
which it is finally charged. If this charge of meal-gunpowder
were to be omitted, the fuse might not be susceptible of
ignition; but the quantity never ought to exceed three lines,
as the fuse would split by the explosion. When the grains
of gunpowder have been well pounded, a trundle or tube,
filled with the aforementioned composition, must be applied,
and it is finally loaded like the rest.</p>

<p>It must be recollected, that two inches of this composition
will last as long as one of the quality, with which common
fuses are charged. Before the fuse is driven into the bomb,
it must be pierced through with a gimblet of one line in diameter;
taking care, that the hole is made precisely through the
charge of meal-powder. One end of a priming match must
be forced in, and three others be tied to it, which three are
to fall upon the bomb, when it lies in the mortar. The particular
object to be obtained by this kind of fuse, is to prevent
the least trace of fire or light being visible in its projection;
so that the enemy may remain ignorant of the range, or
direction of the bomb, and not be able, of course, to get out
of the way when it falls, or to avoid the effects of its explosion.</p>

<p>These fuses were made use of at the siege of Ham
in 1761. The experiments, which were made, in 1792, with
this composition, by an artificer belonging to the ordnance
board, at Douay, have proved, that it answers every purpose,
for which it was invented.</p>

<p>The author of the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Manuel de l'Artilleur</cite> observes, however,
that the advantages to be derived from this invention,
are not so great as they first appear. He remarks, that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
with respect to the real utility of the fuse <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à feu mort</i>, if it
be considered as tending materially to the defence of any
beseiged place, the argument cannot be very forcible, when
we reflect, that to gain time constitutes one of the principal
means of defence, and that the only way to obtain it, is by
retarding the beseigers' operations. These ends are gained
by various expedients. Among others, the common lighted
fuse conduces not a little: since, during the whole direction
of the bomb against the works of the assailants, the attention
of the workmen is diverted from their immediate labour;
and as long as it continues in its range, much uneasiness
is created, because its ultimate explosion and concomitant
destruction are unknown. Add to this, that, independent
of the confusion that is occasioned among the assailants
by repeated projectiles, the bombardier, by means of lighted
fuses, is enabled to correct his aim during the darkest night.
This kind of fuse has been known for many years, and, it is
presumed from these objections to its use, the common fuse
has been hitherto adopted.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. IV. Of the Dimensions of Fuses, and the Dimensions
and Charge of Bombs, Howitzes and Grenades.</i></p>

<p>Shells, in gunnery, are hollow iron balls, to be thrown out
of mortars or howitzers, with a fuse hole of about an inch in
diameter, to load them with powder, and to receive the fuse.
The bottom, or part opposite the fuse, is made heavier than
the rest, that the fuse may fall uppermost. In small elevations,
this is not always the case, nor is it necessary.</p>

<p>Shells are called hollow projectiles, and, besides powder,
various incendiary matters are introduced; but in addition to
shells, properly so called, hollow projectiles comprehend howitzes
and grenades. As a principle, it is observed, that
their sides ought to be proportionably thick to the shock they
receive in the piece, and to the quantity of powder introduced
for bursting them; and their weight, according to the
objects they are to destroy. We remarked, that a shell should
be thicker opposite the fuse. This thickness is called by the
French a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">culot</i>, or reinforcement of metal; the object of
which is to prevent the breaking of the shell on rocks or stone,
as well as to prevent its falling on the fuse. Four times as
much powder may be put in the cavity as is sufficient to burst
them. This admits the introduction of incendiary matter.
Howitzes are hollow balls with a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">culot</i>, or reinforcement of
metal, upon the inside, opposite the eye, and are calculated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
for ricochet, that is, for passing, bounding, over the ground,
and, by striking and penetrating solid objects, and finally
bursting, produce considerable havoc and devastation. For
ricochet, the howitz, in fact, should be of the same thickness
throughout.</p>

<p>Grenades are also a hollow ball, and are of two kinds;
namely, the rampart or ditch grenades, of the caliber of 36,
24, 18, and 12 pounders, designed for rolling along a trough
from the top of the rampart, and falling into the ditch, to
annoy an enemy, in attempting to cross it; and the hand-grenade,
that are thrown by hand into the interior of works, that
are attacked, into covered ways and trenches, &amp;c. They are
of six and three pounder calibers, and their splinters will fly
35 yards. Grenades were invented about the time that shells
were, and first used in 1594. Grenades have sunk into disuse;
but they may be advantageously employed. During the
seige of Cassel, under the count de la Lippe, in the campaign
of 1762, a young engineer undertook to carry one of
the outworks, with a small detachment of men by using grenades,
and in consequence succeeded.</p>

<p>Message shells are nothing more than howitzer shells, and
are so called, because they are used to carry letters or papers.
During the bombardment of Flushing, and while the communication
with Cadsand was cut off, means were found to convey
a letter from the garrison into the latter place. It was
inclosed in a shell without inflammable matter, and discharged
from a mortar, planted on one of the sea batteries.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Shrapnell'">Shrapnel</ins> shells were invented by colonel <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Shrapnell'">Shrapnel</ins> of the
British service. They were used, we are told, with peculiar
effect against the French, in 1808, and at the battle of Waterloo
in 1815. The fuses for these shells, after being turned so
as to fit the fuse-holes, are bored, and a deep thread grooved
inside, to hold the composition firm; and, instead of being
turned with cups, they are hollowed conical, and roughed
with a tool that cuts under, the better to receive the priming.
After they are driven, with fuse composition, one and a half
inches, they are sawed across the top about one-fifth of an
inch down, so as not to touch the composition, and divided
into five equal parts, of two-tenths of an inch each; after
which, a bit of quickmatch is placed across, and drawn tight
in the same grooves. They are then primed with meal-powder
and spirits of wine, capped, and packed for service.</p>

<p>We here insert three tables, which we have extracted from
the work of M. Bigot.</p>

<p>The first table is relative to the dimensions of fuses for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
shells, howitzes, and grenades; the second, respecting the
dimensions of bombs, howitzes, and grenades; and the
third, of the charge of bombs and howitzes.</p>

<p>These tables, taken together, will exhibit all the particulars
on this subject; and as this kind of data is necessary, in
the practical operations of the laboratory, their introduction in
this place, we consider important.</p>

<h3><a name="C_V" id="C_V"></a><a href="#TOC_PART_4">CHAPTER V.</a></h3>

<p class="center"><a name="MILy" id="MILy"></a>OF INCENDIARY FIRE-WORKS.</p>


<p>Under this head are included all artificial preparations,
designed, as the name expresses, to communicate fire to
buildings, shipping, &amp;c. and for other purposes, connected
with the operations of war.</p>

<p>At different periods, even from the remotest antiquity, incendiary
works have been used. Of these preparations, we
may enumerate the following: shells, howitzes, and grenades;
fire-stone to put into shells and howitzes, intended to produce
conflagration; incendiary matches, used in the same
manner; carcasses and fire balls, to be thrown from a mortar,
designed to light up the works in front of a besieged
fortress, and to burn buildings; incendiary, or fire-balls, to
be thrown from cannon or by hand, used in besieged fortresses
to light up the enemy's works; pitched tourteaux and
fascines, to illuminate the passage of rivers and defiles; powder
bags, to throw upon troops mounting to the assault;
powder barrels, to roll from the top of a breach, or from the
head of a sap from the glacis; thundering barrel, employed
for the same purpose; burning or illuminating barrel; petard,
to break down the gates and barriers of small towns, and
even thin walls; torches or flambeaux, to give light during
night marches, and other purposes; rockets, fougettes, and
murdering and the Congreve war rocket, for various uses;
rocket carcass of Congreve, as an incendiary; rocket light
ball, to illuminate the horizon near the enemy; murdering
marrons; Roman incendiary candles, and incendiary stars;
tarred and pitched ropes; fire rain; marine fuses, &amp;c. to
which we may add the ancient Greek fire, and red-hot balls.</p>

<p>In this chapter, under the different heads, we purpose to
describe these, and other fire-works, used in war. We may
remark, also, that animals are sometimes used as incendiary
agents. <i>Rats</i>, for instance, have been employed in certain
enterprizes, as for the purpose of setting fire to magazines
of gunpowder. On these occasions, a lighted match is tied
to the tail of the animal. The <i>courier pigeon</i> of the French,
or carrier pigeon, is not used in this way; but only as a carrier
of letters, to which it is trained and used in Persia and
Turkey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. I. Of Fire Stone.</i></p>

<p>The fire stone (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Roche à feu</i>) is a compact, or solid composition.
It is calculated to burn slowly, and when put into
shells and howitzes, and thrown into cities, produces conflagration.</p>

<p>This stone is composed of sulphur, saltpetre, meal-powder,
and sometimes grain-powder, &amp;c. The sulphur is melted
in a kettle, or glazed earthen vessel, over a clean charcoal
fire; the saltpetre being pulverized, is then thrown into
it, and the spirits of turpentine, if any is used. These articles
are stirred with a spatula, and the fire must be so regulated,
as to prevent the composition from boiling over, or
taking fire. When these are well melted and mixed, they
are taken off the fire, and permitted to cool a little; the gunpowder
is then thrown in, and the composition poured upon
a cold surface, where it consolidates. It is then broken into
small lumps, to be made use of when required.</p>

<p>We may here remark, that, as the goodness of this composition
depends upon the accuracy with which the mixture
is made, too much care cannot be paid to this circumstance.</p>

<p>For the purpose of rendering this incendiary more inflammable,
it is recommended to roll the pieces in meal-powder,
before they become fully hard. If the same composition be
mixed with suet and spirits of turpentine, it is used for the
same purpose, but not in the same manner.</p>

<p>The invention of the fire stone is said to have originated
from the fire-rain of Casimir <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Siemienowich'">Siemienowicz</ins>, an ingenious
Polander, and Chevalier of Lithuania, &amp;c.; and in fact, according
to Ruggieri, the composition was taken from his
treatise.</p>

<p>Incendiaries to be put into bombs or shells, are sometimes
in rolls in the form of a <i>sausage</i>, which continue to
burn after the shell has burst. They infallibly set fire to whatever
combustible substance they touch. When thus made they
are from .88 parts of an inch, to an inch in diameter, and
from 3 to 4 inches long. Carcass composition is generally
used. It is run into cylinders, which are pierced in the
middle, and the hole is filled with the composition of bomb
fuse. They are also furnished with cotton matches.</p>

<p class="p1">Fire stone may be considered the <i>wild-fire</i>; but this term
is applicable to any composition, as the Greek fire, which,
when inflamed, burns with rapidity, and communicates its
fire to surrounding objects with quickness. In such cases,
the combustion is so rapid, that buildings, &amp;c. are immediately
wrapt in flames, which seem almost to defy all human
power to extinguish. Such was the nature of the Greek
fire, of which we shall speak hereafter.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. II. Of Incendiary Matches.</i></p>

<p>These are better for the purpose of putting into shells and
howitzes, than fire-stone alone, which does not burn as well.
Their preparation consists in boiling common slow match in
a solution of 20 parts of saltpetre, in six parts of water; then
drying and cutting it into pieces of two or three inches long,
and immersing it into fire-stone, in a state of fusion. Before
the match has become solid, let it be rolled in meal-powder,
or in grain powder. Fifty pounds of fire-stone will be sufficient
for 1500 matches.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="CARx" id="CARx"></a><i>Sec. III. Of Carcasses and Fire-Balls.</i></p>

<p>Carcasses and fire-balls are made of a composition of combustible
substances, and are used to produce light, as well
as to fire buildings. The difference between them is, that
the carcass has bands or hoops of iron, that form its shell.
These hoops are made at right angles with each other, in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
oval form, and fastened together with a base of iron. The
fire-ball is made of a sack of strong tow cloth, or of a bag of
basket work, in an oval form, and covered with strong cord,
to give it a body. Both, however, are well wrapped with
cord, to make them more solid.</p>

<p>The Rev. J. P. Coste, in 1794, invented a carcass composition,
which he submitted to the French national convention.
It appears that its fire was very violent, which nothing
could extinguish, and could be thrown 800 paces from
a caliber of 24 in. and to a greater distance, if required. An
account of this carcass is given in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moniteur</cite>, No. 342.</p>

<p>Oblong carcasses were formerly in use. The round carcass
is more applicable for mortars and howitzers. The 13-inch
round carcass weighs about 212 lbs., 10-inch 96 lbs., 8-inch
48 lbs., and 5<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>-inch 16 lbs. Carcasses are seldom or
ever fired from guns or carronades, in the land or sea service.
In bomb vessels, they are only fired from mortars.
After the first invention of bombs, that of carcasses and
grenades naturally followed. They are said to have been
first used in 1594, and afterwards by the bishop of Munster,
at the siege of Groll, in 1672, where the Duke of Luxemburg
commanded.</p>

<p>The carcass for 12 and 10-inch mortars has six bands of
iron; that for an 8-inch mortar, no more than four. These
bands are of an oval shape, and fixed with nails, either
clenched or rivetted to a bottom, of the shape of a segment
of a sphere; then to a hoop, placed horizontally at one-third
of their height; and at top, to another that closes the
opening.</p>

<p>The sacks, that contain carcasses and fire-balls, are of a
cylindrical form, and their diameter and height are equal,
being the same as that of the carcass at one-third its height.
They are sewed upon a circular bottom, like the woollen
bags of gun-cartridges. When the ball is wound with thread,
the folds will disappear. The sacks of fire balls are an inch
less than the caliber of the mortar, and those of carcasses
four inches more.</p>

<p class="p1">We may remark, that the four first formulæ are given by
Bigot, and are used in the French service. Therefore, although
the others have been employed, we may consider the
proportions in these, as best adopted for the carcass and
light-ball composition. About 49 lbs. of composition and two
lbs. of fine tow, are required for a carcass of 12 inches.</p>

<p>Luminous or light balls are sometimes made of the following
compositions.</p>

<p class="p1">In the formation of luminous, or light balls, whatever may
be the composition, we may remark, that the only ingredients
which appear to be essentially necessary are nitrate of
potassa and inflammable substances. In some preparations,
antimony is used, for the same reason as in the Bengal
lights. Rosin, pitch, and charcoal are all inflammable; and
sulphur, although it takes fire more instantaneously than
these, enters into the composition of such fires more on account
of its flame than any other.</p>

<p>As a general rule for the preparation of carcass composition,
the following particulars must be attended to. After
melting the pitch, turpentine, rosin, and sulphur, add the
tallow and camphor, and then the nitre and charcoal, in powder.
They are then to be stirred, and mixed intimately.
Care must be taken to regulate the fire, and prevent the composition
taking fire. After the kettle is withdrawn from the
fire, the gunpowder is then gently added, and stirred with a
stick or spatula. The kettle is then again put over the fire,
and afterwards withdrawn. Tow is now added in small
quantities at a time, stirring the mixture well that it may be
thoroughly incorporated.</p>

<p>The preparation of the carcass, or fire-ball, is as follows;
observing, that, if it is a carcass, the iron-frame must be first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
placed in the sack. Four cords are taken, each four lines in
diameter, four feet long for the calibers of 10 and 12 inches,
but only 3 feet for the calibers of 8 inches.</p>

<p>The middle of these four cords are laid one upon the other
in the form of an eight-pointed star. Each end of the ropes
is then fixed to a nail, and a bottom is formed, similar to
basket-work, by interlacing a cord, two lines in diameter,
three or four times round the central point. The small cord
is then tied with a knot, and the bottom of the basket completed,
by tying the four large cords together with four half
knots. The bottom of the sack, containing the iron carcass,
or of an empty sack, if a fire-ball is to be made, is placed
upon the middle of this, and the filling performed in the following
manner, namely: A sufficient quantity of the composition
is taken from the kettle to fill the empty carcass, or
sack, three or four inches high; a few loaded grenades, with
the fuse down, or a howitz placed in the same way, are laid
upon this first layer. The filling is continued to the top,
putting the composition and grenades, in alternate layers.
When it is done, the sack is tied with twine. In order to
tie up the fire-ball in its cord net, the cords are raised from
their nails, over the sack, and tied in such a way as to suspend
it about the height of a man's head, and to permit it to
be easily turned round. An artificer fixes the end of a small
cord to one of the larger ones, at the distance of 1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches
from the bottom; he makes a half knot upon this, and carries
the small cord round to the others, to which he ties it
in the same way, forming a spiral round the ball. The large
cords are kept regularly stretched in such a way, that each
turn of the spiral may be 1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches from that beneath it.
When the spiral has reached the top of the ball, he unites
the small cord, called the traverse, with the ends of the four
others, called uprights. He divides the latter into two parcels,
and forms a loop of them, through which a lever may
be passed for the convenience of carrying it. At two or
three inches from the upper end, and upon two sides, diametrically
opposite to each other, two pins of hard dry wood,
well greased, are driven in. These pins are 6 inches in
length, one in diameter at the head, and half an inch at the
point. They must be inclined in such a way, as to meet in
the axis of the fire ball, at about half its height.</p>

<p>The carcass or fire-ball, when finished, is dipped into the
following composition:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Composition of Pitch for Fire-Balls.</i></p>

</table>

<p>Grenades answer the purpose of dispersing the fire of
the carcass in different places; and the shell will not burst,
till the carcass has burnt for a sufficient length of time.
Sometimes the ends of gun barrels, or pistols, loaded with
ball, are put in.</p>

<p>Carcasses and fire-balls are primed before they are used,
by drawing out the pins, and filling the holes with the composition
for the fuses of shells; taking care to use for ramming,
only wooden or copper rammers. Four cotton matches
are placed in each hole, 6.4 inches long, in order to convey
the fire.</p>

<p>Carcasses and fire-balls are discharged from mortars, in
the same manner as a bomb. When the carcass is intended
to give light to discover the enemy's works, then the small
charges are to be put into the chamber of the mortar, and
but little elevation given, for fear it should bury itself in the
ground. If, on the contrary, the intention is to set fire to
houses or magazines, a greater elevation is given to the
mortars, in order that it may reach and destroy the buildings,
upon which it is intended to fall.</p>

<p>The composition used by the Austrians at the siege of
Valenciennes, which is called after it, has the same effect as
carcass. It is composed of saltpetre 50 parts, sulphur 28,
antimony 18, and rosin 6.</p>

<p>An English writer observes, that the best way of making
light balls, is to take thick brown paper, and make a shell the
size of the mortar, and fill it with a composition of equal
parts of sulphur, pitch, rosin and meal-powder.</p>

<p>Before closing this article, we may add, that carcasses are
sometimes made to weigh two hundred and thirty pounds,
and those for the naval service differ from a shell only in the
composition, and in the four holes, from which it burns when
fired.</p>

<p class="p1">The first composition is reduced to a paste with good brandy
or other spirits, in which gum arabic and camphor have
been dissolved; and after leaving it a few hours to dry,
moisten it with linseed oil, and make it into balls a little less
than the calibers of the guns, from which they are to be fired
or weighing about four pounds, if they are to be thrown by
hand. They are tied up in a cloth and steeped in a bath
of pitch in the same way as carcasses. They are usually
covered a second time with cloth and dipped in the same
way. If they are to be fired from guns, they are enveloped
in a netting of wire, to prevent them from being broke by
the action of the charge. These balls when fired are put
down over a small charge without ramming. Two holes are
made in them in the same way as in carcasses and fire balls
and they are primed in the same manner.</p>

<p>In employing the second and other compositions, the materials
must first be melted, such as rosin, tallow, and sulphur,
and the powder, alum, and antimony, added; when
the melted matter is removed from the fire. After they are
all mixed, the mixture is then poured into wooden moulds
of two pieces, that are greased on the inside; the ball is taken
from the mould when cool, and wrapped up in cloth or
in tow. It is dipped in melted pitch. When it is to be used,
holes are made in it with a gimblet, and it is primed like the
others.</p>

<p>We may remark here, that the Congreve incendiary rocket
is armed with carcass composition, which produces all the
effects of the usual carcass. The rocket carcass will be considered
under the head of war-rocket.</p>

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. V. Of Smoke Balls.</i></p>

<p>Smoke balls are composed of the same substances as carcasses
and light balls, with this difference, that they contain five
to one of pitch, rosin, and sawdust. This composition is
put into shells made for the purpose, having four holes to
let out the smoke. Smoke balls are thrown out of mortars,
and continue to smoke from twenty-five to thirty minutes.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VI. Of Stink Balls.</i></p>

<p>Stink Balls are prepared with a composition of mealed
powder, rosin, saltpetre, pitch, sulphur, rasped horses' and
asses' hoofs, burnt in the hoof, assafœtida, seraphim-gum,
stinking herbs, &amp;c. made up into balls in the same manner
as light-balls, according to the size of the mortar, out of
which they are to be thrown.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="POIy" id="POIy"></a><i>Sec. VII. Of Poisoned Balls.</i></p>

<p>With respect to poisoned balls, we are informed, that, although
they have not been used by European nations, the
Africans and the Indians have always been very ingenious at
poisoning several kinds of fire compositions. At the commencement
of the French revolution, poisoned balls were exhibited
to the people, pretended to have been fired by the
Austrians, particularly at the seige of Lisle. They contained
glass, small pieces of iron, &amp;c. and were said to be mixed
with a greasy composition, which was impregnated with
poisonous matter. In 1792, they were deposited in the archives
of Paris.</p>

<p>Poisoned balls, according to authors, are composed of meal
powder four parts, pitch six, rosin three, sulphur five, assafœtida
eight, extract of toads' poison twelve, other poisonous
substances twelve, made into balls in the manner we have
mentioned. See <a href="#POIx"><i>Poisoned Arrow</i>.</a></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. VIII. Of Red-hot Balls.</i></p>

<p>It will be sufficient to observe, that red-hot shot, as an incendiary,
are considered fully adequate to perform the effect
which they are designed to produce. The balls are ignited
in a coal fire on an iron grate, in a furnace constructed
for the purpose; and, when thus heated, are thrown from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
guns, the space between the powder and ball being filled up
with a piece of wood of the exact diameter of the gun, or
with wet hay or grass, to prevent the ball from setting fire to
the powder.</p>

<p>With respect to chain balls, composed of two balls linked
together by a chain from twelve inches to four feet in length,
and designed to destroy palisadoes, wooden bridges, and chevaux-de-frize
of a fortification; stang-balls, or bar-shot,
called by some, balls of two heads, made by uniting, by means
of a bar, half shot; and anchor balls, filled with the same
composition as light-balls, with some trifling variation in the
ball itself, &amp;c.&mdash;they are all used as destructive weapons,
which belong more particularly to the service of artillery.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="TOUx" id="TOUx"></a><i>Sec. IX. Of Pitched Tourteaux and Fascines.</i></p>

<p>Tourteaux are employed to illuminate the passages of rivers
and defiles. They are placed in portable <i>lanterns</i> or
in fire-grates. They are used chiefly to light up the works
of the beseiger, when he approaches the covert way, and to
burn the gabions and fascines, with which he constructs his
passage to the ditch. Tarred links are nothing more than
old junk or matches, dipped into a composition of pitch, suet,
linseed oil and turpentine; the junk being cut into lengths of
about five feet, which is called a link. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tourteaux goudronnés</i>
of the French are the same, and formed of old rope,
which is untwisted, immersed in pitch or tar, and afterwards
left to dry. The French make the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tourteaux goudronnés</i> in
the following manner: Take twelve pounds of tar or pitch,
six pounds of tallow, and three pints of linseed oil; melt
them together and dip twisted pieces of rope of any length
into the boiling mixture. If they are required to burn slow,
six pounds of rosin and two pounds of turpentine are added.
Sometimes to the composition of pitch, tallow, and linseed oil,
are added two parts of saltpetre, one part of sulphur, and
half a part of antimony. Tourteaux, according to Bigot, are
made in the following manner: Old cords or pieces of match
are beaten with mallets to take out the dirt, and prepare
them to receive the composition. They are untwisted a little
for the same purpose. They are then cut into pieces about
five feet in length, and each is intertwined to form a circle of
five or six inches of external diameter, making a hole at the
same time in the middle for the passage of the point of the
lantern.</p>

<p>The rope, being thus prepared, is next boiled in the com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>position
given below, for the space of ten or fifteen minutes,
and then laid upon a wet plank. They are a second time
dipped into the composition, and thrown into cold water, to
give them again, by hand, the circular figure they may have
lost. Flower of sulphur is now put over them, and they are
dried in the shade.</p>

The links will cost less, and they will answer the purpose
equally well.</p>

<p>Fascines are made of strips of wood, or dry twigs, or
wine shoots, which are the best, of the length of fourteen or
sixteen inches. They are tied in bundles of four or five inches
in diameter, with a cord or iron wire, and then boiled
in the composition for tourteaux, and thrown into water to
cool. They are principally used to give light to the works
of an enemy, and to set fire to the passage of the ditch.</p>

<p>Fascines are of different kinds. In fortification, they are a
kind of fagot, made of small branches of trees or brush wood,
tied in three, four, five, or six places, and are of various dimensions,
according to the purposes intended. Those that
are to be pitched over for burning lodgements, galleries, or
any other work of the enemy, should be one and a half or
two feet long.</p>

They are made in the following manner.</p>

<p>Boil, in a mixture of equal parts of water and saltpetre, old
cords or old match, well cleaned and untwisted. Take them
out and dry them; then cut them in pieces of four and a
half feet in length, and tie four of these pieces with twine
to a cylindrical piece of wood, of the same length, and an
inch in diameter; so that the whole together may be from
two to two and a half inches thick. Dip this torch into a liquid
made of equal parts of meal-powder and sulphur, mixed
together with brandy, in which some gum has been
dissolved. Fill the intervals of the pieces of cordage, with
a paste, composed of three parts of sulphur, and one of
quicklime. Dry the torch, and when dry, turn it gently
round, and finish it by pouring on it the following composition.</p>

<p class="centerx"><a name="POWx" id="POWx"></a><i>Sec. XI. Of Powder Bags.</i></p>

<p>Powder bags are little sacks, that contain four pounds of
powder.</p>

<p>They are of great use in besieged places. They are cast
by the hand, set fire wherever they fall, and very much intimidate
troops making an assault. They are made with good
coarse cloth. Their width and size are not determined. It
is sufficient that they can be easily thrown. The sides only
are sewed up. In charging them, we begin by tying one end
with strong packthread. Then turn it inside out, so that
the ligature may be within, and fill it with powder, ramming
it down with a cartridge form, proportioned to the bag, until
it is full. Then put in the fuse, the large end inwards, and
tie the bag tight. Afterwards the outside is covered with
tar, or pitch.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XII. Of the Powder Barrel.</i></p>

<p>A powder barrel is a common barrel, filled with powder,
to roll from the top of a breach, or upon the head of a sap
from the glacis. The barrel contains from 100 to 200 pounds
of powder, and is covered with a cloth. A hole is made at
each end, in which a fuse may be fixed, of such a size, that
the fire may be communicated to the powder, at the moment
when the barrel, rolled from the top of the breach, is met by
the troops mounting to the assault.</p>

<p>English writers state the diameter of powder barrels at 16
inches, and 30 or 32 inches in length, and capable of holding
100 pounds of powder. The quantity of powder put into
them is 90 lbs; into a half-barrel, 45 lbs; and into a quarter-barrel,
used for rifle powder, only 22<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> lbs. This proportion
leaves a space for the powder to separate when rolled, or
otherwise it would always be in lumps, and liable thereby to
damage.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XIII. Of the Burning or Illuminating Barrel.</i></p>

<p>This barrel differs from the thundering barrel, which we
shall describe in the following section, only in having no grenades;
and when it is placed upon a glacis, it lights up or discovers
the works of the besieger. It has a fuse in only one
of its ends.</p>

<p>When shavings are boiled in the composition for links and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
fascines, or of tourteaux, and arranged layer by layer, scattering,
over each stratum, some priming-powder, the combustion
must be rapid, when the barrel is set on fire.</p>

<p>Fire barrels, we may observe, are of different kinds. Some
are mounted on wheels, filled with composition, and intermixed
with loaded grenades, and their outsides full of sharp
spikes. Some are placed under ground, and have the effect of
small mines; and others, as the kind we have mentioned, are
used to roll down a breach to prevent the entrance of the enemy.
The following composition has been used for the same
purpose.</p>

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XIV. Of the Thundering Barrel.</i></p>

<p>This is employed for the same purpose as the preceding,
or to light up the works of the besieger at the foot of the
glacis. It has the same dimensions with the other, but has no
cover. It is filled with chips, (dipped into the composition
of the tourteaux), which are arranged in layers, putting, between
each layer, meal-powder, and grenades, furnished with
their fuses, or with pieces of musket barrels. The first and
last layers are made with tow, boiled in the carcass composition.
The barrel being filled, it is then closed and primed
in the same way as the powder barrel, with a bomb fuse at
each end. Holes are made along the barrel to assist the combustion.
Grenades are employed in particular to prevent the
approach of persons to extinguish the flame.</p>

<p>The invention of bombs is said to be owing to Scotland,
and to the siege of St. Andrews. In the <cite>Art of War</cite> (says
the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthologia Hibernica</cite>, vol. iii, p. 174) printed at Venice,
we are shown the representation of a hogshead, coated with
conical headed nails, in which there is enclosed a barrel of
gunpowder, suspended in the centre by an iron tube, which
communicates at both ends with the open air. This engine,
we are told by the author, killed 558 persons by its explosion
in the fosse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XV. Of the Petard.</i></p>

<p>The petard is used to break down the gates and barriers
of small towns, and even their walls, by hanging it against
them, and setting fire to the fuse. Its invention is ascribed
to the French Huguenots in 1579, who, by means of petards,
took Cahors, in the same year. It was invented, as others inform
us, by the celebrated Coehorn.</p>

<p>The petard is a hollow piece of iron, either cast or wrought,
of the figure of a truncated cone, and usually eight inches
high, and nine and a half inches diameter at the base, the
metal being five-sixths of an inch thick at top, and half an
inch at bottom. It is open at the large end; and the small
end, which is rounded, is pierced with a hole, in which is
placed a brass fuse, filled with composition, in lieu of which,
however, an ordinary bomb-fuse, or a quick-match may be
used. It is furnished with four trunnions, (one and a half
inches by one), to receive the iron staples, that are attached
to an oaken plank, eighteen inches square, and two and a half
inches thick, and reinforced below by two iron bands, in the
form of a cross, nailed and dove-tailed in. It has two iron
handles to carry it by, and to hook it to a screw, fixed in the
gate intended to be broken. It is filled with gunpowder.</p>

<p>When the petard is to be loaded, it is filled with powder
to within three inches of the bottom. Some folds of cartridge
paper are then put in, and a bed of tow well rammed. It is
finished with a hot cement made of one part of rosin, and
two parts of ground brick, or Spanish brown. A plate of
iron four or five lines thick is set into this, that fits the inside
of the petard at that part. It is furnished with three
iron points, to be driven into the plank. A petard, ready for
use, weighs eighty-five pounds, and contains nine pounds of
powder.</p>

<p class="p1">According to Ruggeri, a petard is filled, after warming
it, with three fingers of powder, which is moistened with
brandy, and then compressed without crushing it. On this
powder, a quick match is placed, which is also compressed;
after which, it is filled with composition previously melted.
The composition is as follows:</p>

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XVI. Of the Stink-Fire Lance.</i></p>

<p>This lance (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lance à feu puant</i> of the French) is prepared
in the same manner as stink-pots, and is principally
used by miners. When a miner or sapper has so far penetrated
towards the enemy, as to hear the voices of persons
in any place contiguous to his own excavation, he first
of all bores a hole with his <i>probe</i>, then fires off several pistols
through the aperture, and lastly forces in a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lance à feu
puant</i>. He takes care to close up the hole on his side, to prevent
the smoke from returning towards himself. The explosion
and fetid gas and vapour, which issue from the lance,
and remain on the side of the enemy, infect the air so much,
that it is impossible to approach the quarter for three or four
days. Sometimes, indeed, they have had such instantaneous
effect, that, in order to save their lives, miners, who would
persevere, have been dragged out in an apparent state of suffocation.</p>

<p>The composition of ordinary fire-lance has been given.
They are sometimes used to set fire to fuses.</p>

<p>The fire-pot is a vessel made of clay, with two handles,
in which a grenade with powder is confined, and which is
thrown against an enemy, after the match has been lighted;
but a stink-pot is a vessel, filled with combustible and other
matter, used in boarding ships, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span></p>

<p>The suffocating pot is another contrivance, as its name
expresses, to produce suffocation; and, as the materials consist
only of sulphur and nitre, the gas which principally produces
this effect is the sulphurous acid.</p>

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XVII. Of the Combustible Substances used in, and the
Manner of preparing, a Fire-Ship.</i></p>

<p>A fire-ship is a vessel, filled with combustible substances,
and fitted with grappling irons, to hook, and set fire to the
enemy's ships in battle, &amp;c.</p>

<p>With respect to the preparation required, some knowledge
may be had by considering the following particulars. From
the bulk-head at the fore-castle, to a bulk-head to be raised
behind the main chains, on each side, and across the ship at
the bulk-heads, is fixed, close to the ship's sides, a double row
of troughs, two feet distance from each other, with cross
troughs quite round, at about two and a half feet distance,
which are mortised into the others. The cross troughs lead
to the sides of the ship, to the barrels, and to the port-holes,
to give fire both to the barrels and to the chambers, to blow
open the ports; and the side troughs serve to communicate
the fire all along the ship, and the cross troughs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span></p>

<p>The timbers, of which the troughs are made, are about
five inches square; the depth of the trough, half their
thickness; and they are supported by cross-pieces at every
two or three yards, nailed to the timbers of the ship, and
to the wood-work, which encloses the fore and mainmasts.
The decks and troughs are all well payed with melted rosin.
On each side of the ship, six small port-holes are cut, from
fifteen to eighteen inches large, (the ports opening downwards),
and are close caulked up.</p>

<p>Against each port is fixed an iron chamber, which, at the
time of firing the ship, blows open the ports and lets out the
fire. At the main and fore chains, on each side, a wooden
funnel is fixed over a fire-barrel, and comes through a scuttle
in the deck, up to the shrouds to set them on fire. Both funnels
and scuttles must be stopped with plugs, and have sail-cloth
or canvass nailed close over them to prevent any accident
happening that way by fire to the combustibles below.</p>

<p>The port-holes, funnels, and scuttles, not only serve to give
the fire a free passage to the outside and upper parts of the
ship and her rigging, but also to allow the inward air (otherwise
confined) to expand itself, and push through those
holes at the time of the combustibles being on fire, and prevent
the blowing up of the decks, which otherwise must happen
from the sudden and violent rarefaction of the air.</p>

<p>In the bulkhead behind on each side, is cut a small hole,
large enough to receive a trough of the same size as the
others, from which, to each side of the ship, lies a leading
trough, one end coming through a sally port, cut through the
ship's side, and the other fixing into a communicating trough,
that lies along the bulk head, from one side of the ship to
the other; and being laid with quick-match, at the time of
firing either of the leading troughs, it communicates the
fire, in an instant, to the contrary side of the ship, and both
sides burn together.</p>

<p>Having thus described this preparatory arrangement, we
shall consider, in the next place, the combustibles made use
of in fitting up a fire-ship.</p>

<p><i>Fire-barrel.</i> The fire-barrels for this purpose are cylindrical,
on account of that shape answering better both for
filling them with reeds, and for stowing them between the
troughs. Their inside diameters are about 21 inches, and
their length 33. The bottom parts are first filled with double-dipt
reeds, set on end, and the remainder with fire-barrel
composition, made of the following substances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Composition for fire-barrels, for fire-ships.</i></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">

</table>

<p class="p1">There are 5 holes of three-quarters of an inch in diameter,
and 3 inches deep, made with a drift of that size, in the top
of the composition, while it is warm; one in the centre, and
the other four at equal distances, round the sides of the barrel.</p>

<p>When the composition is cold and hard, the barrel is primed
by well driving these holes, full of fuse composition, to
within an inch of the top; then fixing in each hole a strand
of quick-match twice doubled, and in the centre hole, two
strands the whole length; all which must be well driven with
meal-powder. Then lay the quick-match all within the barrel,
and cover the top of it with a dipped curtain, fastened on
with a hoop to slip over the head, and nailed on.</p>

<p><i>Bavins.</i> Bavins are made of birch, heath, or other sort of
brush wood, that is both tough and quickly fired. Their
length is 2<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> to 3 feet. The bush ends are all laid one way,
and the other ends, tied with two bands each. They are dipped,
and sprinkled with sulphur, the same as reeds; with this
difference, that the bush ends only are dipped, and should be
a little closed together by the hand as soon as done, to keep
them more compact, in order to produce a stronger fire, and
to preserve the branches from breaking in shifting and handling
them.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Composition for Bavins.</i></p>

<p class="p1"><i>Iron Chambers.</i> These are ten inches long, and 3.5 in diameter;
breeched against a piece of wood, fixed across the
holes. When loaded, they are almost filled with grained
powder, with a wooden tompion well driven into their muzzles.
They are primed with a small piece of quick-match,
thrust through their vents into the powder, with a part of it
hanging out; and, when the ship is fired, they blow open the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
ports, which either fall downwards, or are carried away, and
accordingly give vent to the fire out of the sides of the ship.</p>

<p><i>Curtains.</i> Curtains are made of barras, about three-quarters
of a yard wide, and one yard in length. When they are
dipped, two men, with each a fork, must run the prongs
through the corner of the curtain at the same end. Then
dip them into a large kettle of composition, (which is the
same as the composition for bavins,) well melted; and, when
well dipped and the curtain extended to its full breadth,
whip it between two sticks of about 5.5 feet long, and 1.5
inches square, held close by two other men, to take off the superfluous
composition hanging to it. Then immediately sprinkle
sawdust on both sides, to prevent it from sticking, and
the curtain is finished.</p>

<p><i>Reeds.</i> They are made up in small bundles of about 12
inches in circumference, cut even at both ends, and tied with
two bands each. The longest sort are 4 feet, and the shortest
2.5, the only lengths which are used. One part of them
is single dipped, only at one end; the rest are double dipped,
that is, at both ends. In dipping, they must be put about 7
or 8 inches deep into a copper kettle of melted composition, of
the same kind as that for bavins; and, when they have drained
a little over it, to carry off the superfluous composition, sprinkle
them, over a tanned hide, with pulverized sulphur, at
some distance from the copper. With respect to the stores,
required for a fire ship of 150 tons, the following complement
is given: <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XVIII. On Infernal Machines.</i></p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Machines Infernales</i> of the French, which have excited
so much attention in Europe, we deem of sufficient importance
to describe.</p>

<p>This invention is by no means new, although it has been
attributed to the French. It appears that Fredric Jambelli,
an Italian engineer, was the first that used them, when Alexander,
of Parma, besieged Antwerp. The Prince of Orange
likewise had recourse to the destructive effects of an infernal
machine, in order to bombard Havre-de-Grace, and to set it
on fire. The Dutch and English, in conjunction, attempted
to destroy St. Malo by the same means. The first instance,
however, upon record, in which the French made use of this
machine, was when Louis XIV ordered a vessel, carrying
an enormous shell, full of every kind of combustible
matter, to be despatched to Algiers, for the purpose of demolishing
its harbour. This, it is supposed, suggested the
use of fire-ships, which have frequently been used against
maritime places.</p>

<p>The author of the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Œuvres Militaires</cite>, tom. xxii, p. 222,
speaking of the infernal machine, observes, that, if he were
to be in a situation, which required the use of so dreadful
an explosion, especially to destroy a bridge, he would prefer
having the machine made simply with different strong pieces
of wood, joined together, so as to be in the shape of an egg,
or of a cone reversed.</p>

<p>The whole must then be made compact with cords twisted
round. This method, in his opinion, is not only the best, but
can be executed in the most easy and expeditious manner.
He further adds, that, in order to burn or blow up wooden
bridges, and even to destroy such as are constructed upon
arches, several sorts of barges or boats might be used,
which should be filled with fire-works, bombs, petards, &amp;c.
It would, likewise, be easy to construct these machines upon
floating rafters, carrying several thousand pounds weight of
gunpowder, which might be confined within strong pieces
of wood, put together in the manner already described.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span></p>

<p>These machines should be piled one above another, and
long iron bars must be thrown across the floats, or be fixed
like masts; so that, when the whole of the combustible material
is beneath the centre of the bridge, the rafters may be
stopped. Great care must be taken to dispose the matches
in such a manner, that no fire may be communicated to the
gunpowder before the machine reaches the exact spot, which
is to be destroyed.</p>

<p>In 1804, an infernal machine was used at Boulogne, which
is described as follows:</p>

<p>This machine appears to be as simple in its construction,
as it is calculated to be effectual in its operations. It is composed
of 2 stout planks, 17 feet long, which form its sides,
and are distant from each other about 7 feet.</p>

<p>These planks are connected by transverse timbers, screwed
to the planks; so as to keep the whole firm and compact, and
to prevent the danger of their being separated at sea. Of
these transverse timbers, two are at the fore extremity, and
three behind. This may be called, the frame or hull of the
machine; the remainder of the work, being either for the
stowage of the combustible matter, or for the accommodation
of the seamen, who row the machine. Along the transverse
timbers, at both extremities, are laid parallel to the sides,
five longitudinal bars of nearly the same strength as the
transverse timbers, which form a kind of grate, on which
the coffers, containing the combustible matter, are placed.
The grate behind is double the size of the one before, on
the principle of giving facility to the motion of the whole,
by making the machine lighter at the head. In the centre,
between the planks forming the sides, from the inner extremity
of the grate behind, to the outer extremity of the grate
before, there is fixed a plank, somewhat broader than the
side planks, which is well secured to them by three stout
transverse timbers, which pass under the centre plank, to
prevent its giving way to pressure.</p>

<p>In this plank, two triangular apertures are cut for men who
row, to dispose of the lower extremities, whilst they ply the
machine. Their seats, however, are so contrived, that each
man's pressure is directly over that part of the plank, which
is supported by the transverse timbers. The seats lie nearer
to the head than to the hind part of the machine; perhaps to
be some counterpoise for the greater weight of the combustible
matter behind. Near each seat are fastened by rings
to the sides, two oars, one on each side, and each man plies
a pair. When the machine is worked to its destination, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
men set the combustibles in a train for explosion, and abandon
their posts.</p>

<p>The whole is so regulated, as to weight of materials, that
the machine floats, or, more probably, moves under the surface
of the water; so that little more than the heads of the
men are seen. This secures the men and the machine from
the fire of the enemy; and as the oars must be constantly
plied under water, there is less danger of their being discovered
by their noise, as they approach.</p>

<p>Infernal machines have also been made, to be used on
land. Such is the machine we are told, which was intended
for the destruction of Bonaparte. They may be made to explode
at a given time, by clock-work, or by a match, calculated
to burn a certain time!</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XIX. Of the Catamarin.</i></p>

<p>The catamarin, properly so called, is a floating raft, originally
used in China, and among the Portuguese as a fishing-boat.
The Indian catamarin consists of two logs of wood,
upon which the natives float, and go through the heaviest
surf.</p>

<p>The military or naval catamarin is a different thing. It is
properly a case, filled with combustibles, and contrived to remain
so low in the water as to be almost imperceptible. This,
being towed to the building, or ship, against which the
attack is to be directed, is left to explode, by means of machinery
within itself, when its operation is sometimes very
destructive.</p>

<p>English writers acknowledge, that the catamarin, submitted
by the late Mr. Pitt to the English government, and
which cost in its construction a considerable sum, was originally
invented by our countryman, the late Mr. Fulton, of
whose invention we will speak hereafter.</p>

<p>Some observations on a boat, named, by the French, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chelingues</i>,
and the Indian catamarin, may be seen in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Dictionaire'">Dictionnaire</ins>
de l'Industrie</cite>, article <i>Bateau</i>.</p>

<p>Several diving machines have been invented in France and
elsewhere. M. Castera (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives des Découvertes</cite>, iii, p.
185) describes a <i>plunging boat</i>, which resembles in figure
a cone. It is furnished with a reservoir, calculated to hold
water, and may be filled or emptied by means of pumps. By
means of glasses and copper handles, the navigator is enabled
to see and to take hold of objects. It is also furnished with
tubes for the transmission of the air necessary for respiration,
that communicate from the interior of the vessel with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
atmosphere; and a double bellows, designed as well for receiving,
as expelling air. Besides oars or paddles, necessary
to move it under water, there is a contrivance for detaching
the boat from the reservoir, either wholly or in part, according
to circumstances.</p>

<p>M. Castera, in a memoir on <i>sub-marine navigation</i>, has
noticed several applications of the plunging boat, which may
be seen in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bulletin de la Société d'Encouragement</cite>, No. 71.
In No. 61, of the same work, is the first notice of Castera's
invention, an extract of which may be seen in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives
des Découvertes</cite>, ii. p. 121. A description of Lutgendorf's
boat may be seen in the <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Magazin der Erfindungen</cite>, No. 46.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XX. Of the American Turtle.</i></p>

<p>It is well known that the diving-bell, and similar contrivances,
have been used for naval purposes, in connection
with naval warfare.</p>

<p>Divers, or those who made it a business, by long habit
and experience, to remain under water, and go to a great
depth, were often employed in war to destroy the works and
ships of the enemy. When Alexander was besieging Tyre,
divers swam off from the city, under water, to a great distance,
and, with long hooks, tore to pieces the mole, with
which the besiegers were endeavouring to block up the harbour.
The invention of the diving-bell, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">campana urinatoria</i>
of some, is generally assigned to the sixteenth century;
but it is evident, from the writings of Aristotle and others,
that, in his time, divers used a kind of kettle to enable them
to continue longer under water.</p>

<p>At the pearl fisheries, in the Bay of Condalzchy, in Ceylon,
divers usually remain under water two minutes. There
are some who can stay five minutes; and a diver from Anjano,
engaged in this fishery in 1797, was able to remain six
minutes under water. But their efforts are so great, that,
when they come up, blood frequently issues from their
mouths, ears, and nostrils. Notwithstanding this, they frequently
dive from forty to fifty times a day, and bring up in
a bag-net a hundred oysters each time.</p>

<p>It may be proper to observe, that the subject of sub-marine
navigation was largely descanted upon by Mersennus,
(<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tractatus de Magnetis Proprietatibus</cite>), and by Bishop
Wilkins (<cite>Mathematical Magic</cite>, 1648), who, by the way, is
rather visionary. The conveniences and advantages he enumerates,
are: 1. 'Privacy, as a man may thus go to any part
of the world invisibly, without being discovered or prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>ed.
2. Safety, from the uncertainty of tides and tempests,
&amp;c. 3. It may be used to blow up, or undermine a navy: 4.
Or to relieve a blockaded place, &amp;c. But, with regard to
the use of sub-marine vessels in war, Mr. David Bushnel,
of Saybrook, Connecticut, appears to be entitled to the credit
of the invention. His account of it may be seen in the <cite>Transactions
of the American Philosophical Society</cite>. The intended
object of this vessel was to destroy shipping, by the explosion
of a magazine of gunpowder.</p>

<p>In Silliman's <cite>Journal of Science and Arts</cite>, vol. II, p. 94, is
a communication by Mr. Griswold, on the subject of Bushnel's
machine, with an account of the first attempt with it, in
August, 1776, by Ezra Lee, a sergeant in the American
army, to destroy some of the British ships then lying at New
York. Mr. Griswold remarks, that, considering the invention
of Mr. Bushnel as the first of its kind, it will be pronounced
to be remarkably complete throughout in its construction,
and that such an invention furnishes evidence of
those resources and creative powers, which must rank him
as a mechanical genius of the first order.</p>

<p>He has given a description of it; but the outline which we
give is taken from <cite>Nicholson's Journal</cite>, quarto, iv, p. 229.</p>

<p>It is a decked boat, to go underwater: and several persons
have gone under water many leagues. The difficulty is, to
provide the persons in the boat with fresh air for respiration;
and this is contrived, by having a reservoir of air, of suitable
dimensions to the size of the boat, and the number of persons
in it. By means of a condensing pump, the air, in this
reservoir, is condensed about 400 times; and by a spring, the
air is let out at intervals, as circumstances require, the carbonic
acid produced by respiration being absorbed by quicklime.
Within this boat are flaps, like those of a rundle, to
move the boat, two rudders, one vertical, the other horizontal,
and a pump to empty the hold, or air reservoir. The
person within, can, at pleasure, come to the top of the water.
The different experiments made by Mr. Bushnel may be
seen in the <cite>Transactions</cite> referred to, or in <cite>Nicholson's Journal</cite>,
quarto, iv, 229.</p>

<p>During the late war, Mr. Fulton, Mr. Mix, and some
others, made various experiments with submarine machines;
and during the revolution, the incendiary kegs, well known
by the name of the "<i>battle of the kegs</i>," excited no small attention,
and, had it not been for some unforeseen circumstance,
they would, in all probability, have produced the
effect for which they were intended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span></p>

<p>Of Bushnel's vessel, we may observe, that, in the fore
part of the brim of the crown, as it is called, was a socket,
and an iron tube <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'passsing'">passing</ins> through the socket. The tube
stood upright, and could slide up and down in the socket,
six inches. At the top of the tube was a wood screw, fixed
by means of a rod, which passed through the tube, and
screwed the wood screw fast upon the top of the tube. By
pushing the wood screw up against the bottom of a ship, and
turning it at the same time, it would enter the planks. When
the wood screw was firmly fixed, it could be cast off by unscrewing
the rod, which fixed it upon the top of the tube.</p>

<p>Behind the submarine vessel, was a place, above the rudder,
for carrying a large powder magazine. This was made
of two pieces of oak timber, sufficiently large, when hollowed
out, to contain 150 lbs. of powder, (130 lbs. according to
Griswold,) with the apparatus used in firing it, and was secured
in its place by a screw, turned by the operator. A
strong piece of rope extended from the magazine to the
wood screw above mentioned, and was fastened to both.
When the wood screw was fixed, and to be cast off from its
tube, the magazine was to be cast off likewise by unscrewing
it, leaving it hanging to the wood screw; it was lighter
than the water, that it might rise up against the object, and
apply itself when fastened.</p>

<p>Mr. Griswold remarks, that the most difficult point of all
to be gained, was to fasten this magazine to the bottom of a
ship.</p>

<p>Within the magazine, was a machine, constructed to run
any proposed length of time under twelve hours. When it
had run out its time, it unpinioned a strong lock resembling
a gun-lock, which gave fire to the powder. This apparatus
was so pinioned, that it could not possibly move, till, by
casting off the magazine from the vessel, it was set in motion.</p>

<p>This skilful operator could swim so low on the surface of
the water, as to approach very near a ship in the night without
fear of discovery, and might, if he chose, approach the
stem or stern above water, with very little danger. He
could sink very quickly, keep at any depth he pleased,
and row a great distance in any direction he desired, without
coming to the surface; and, when he rose to the surface,
he could soon obtain a fresh supply of air; when, if necessary,
he might descend again and pursue his course. The
projector found some time and attention to be requisite for
the gradual instruction of this operator, and, after various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
attempts, he found one, on whom he thought he could depend.
He sent this man from New York to a 50 gun ship,
lying not far from Governor's island. He went under the
ship, and attempted to fix the wood screw in her bottom, but
struck, as he supposed, a bar of iron, which passes from the
rudder's hinge, and is spiked under the ship's quarter. Had
he removed a few inches, which he might have done without
rowing, the projector has no doubt but he might have
found wood, where he might have fixed the screw; or if the
ship were sheathed with copper, he might easily have
pierced it. But, not being well skilled in the management
of the vessel, in attempting to row to another place, he lost
the ship. After seeking her in vain some time, he rowed to
some distance, and rose to the surface of the water, but
found day light had advanced so far, that he durst not renew
the attempt. He says, he could easily have fastened
the magazine under the stern of the ship above the water, as
he rowed up to the stern, and touched it before he descended.
Had he fixed it there, the explosion of 150 lbs of gunpowder
(the quantity contained in the magazine) must have
been fatal to the ship. In his return from the ship to New
York, he passed near Governor's island, and thought he was
discovered by the enemy on the island. Being in haste to
avoid the danger he feared, he cast off the magazine, as he
imagined it retarded him in the swell, which was very considerable.
After the magazine had been cast off an hour,
the time the internal apparatus was set to run, it blew up
with great violence.</p>

<p>Mr. Griswold gives an account of an attempt to destroy
a ship of war; and having received his information from Mr.
Lee, one of the adventurers, we have thought proper to introduce
it from that source.</p>

<p>"It was in the month of August, 1776, when Admiral
Howe lay with a formidable British fleet in New York bay,
a little above the narrows, and a numerous British force upon
Staten Island, commanded by General Howe, threatened
annihilation to the troops under Washington, that Mr. Bushnel
requested General Parsons, of the American army, to
furnish him with two or three men to learn the navigation of
his new machine, with the view of destroying some of the
enemy's shipping.</p>

<p>"General Parsons immediately sent for Lee, then a sergeant,
and two others, who had offered their services to
go on board a fire ship; and on Bushnel's request being
made known to them, they enlisted themselves under him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
for this novel piece of service. The party went up into
Long Island sound with the machine, and made various experiments
with it in the different harbours along shore; and
after having become pretty thoroughly acquainted with the
mode of navigating it, they returned through the sound; but,
during their absence, the enemy had got possession of
Long Island and Governor's Island. They, therefore, had
the machine conveyed by land across from New Rochelle
to the Hudson river, and afterwards arrived with it at New
York.</p>

<p>"The British fleet now lay to the north of Staten Island,
with a large number of transports, and were the objects
against which this new mode of warfare was destined to act.
The first serene night was fixed upon for the execution of
this perilous enterprize, and sergeant Lee was to be the engineer.
After a lapse of a few days, a favourable night arrived,
and, at 11 o'clock, a party embarked in two or three
whale boats, with Bushnel's machine in tow. They rowed
down as near the fleet as they dared, when sergeant Lee entered
the machine, was cast off, and the boats returned.</p>

<p>"Lee now found the ebb tide rather too strong, and before
he was aware, had drifted him down past the men of war.
He, however, immediately <i>got the machine about</i>, and by hard
labour at the crank for the space of five glasses by the ship's
bells, two and a half hours, he arrived under the stern of
one of the ships at about slack water. Day had now dawned,
and by the light of the moon he could see the people on
board, and hear their conversation. This was the moment
for diving: he accordingly closed up over head, let in water,
and descended under the ship's bottom. <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'He how'">He now</ins> applied the
screw, and did all in his power to make it enter; but owing
probably in part to the ship's copper, and the want of an adequate
pressure, to enable the screw to get a hold on the bottom,
his attempts all failed. At each essay, the machine rebounded
from the ship's bottom, not having sufficient power
to resist the impulse thus given to it. He next paddled
along to a different part of her bottom, but, in this manœuvre,
he made a deviation, and instantly rose to the water's
surface on the east side of the ship, exposed to the increasing
light of the morning, and in imminent hazard of being
discovered. He immediately made another descent, with a
view of making one more trial; but the fast approach of
day, which would expose him to the enemy's boats, and
render his escape difficult, if not impossible, deterred him;
and he concluded the best generalship would be, to com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>mence
an immediate retreat. He now had before him a
distance of more than four miles to traverse, but the tide
was favourable. At Governor's island, great danger awaited
him; for his compass having got out of order, he was
under the necessity of looking out from the top of the machine
very frequently, to ascertain its course, and at first
made a very irregular zigzag track. The soldiers at Governor's
island espied the machine, and curiosity drew several
hundreds upon the parapet to watch its motions. At last
a party came down to the beach, shoved off a barge, and
rowed towards it. At that moment, sergeant Lee thought
he saw his certain destruction, and as the last act of defence,
let go the magazine, expecting they would seize that likewise,
and thus all would be blown to atoms together. Providence,
however, otherwise directed it: the enemy, after approaching
within 50 or 60 yards of the machine, and seeing
the magazine detached, began to suspect a <i>yankee trick</i>, took
alarm, and returned to the island. Approaching the city,
he soon made a signal; the boats came to him, and brought
him safe and sound to the shore. The magazine, in the
mean time, had drifted past Governor's island into the East
river, where it exploded with tremendous violence, throwing
large columns of water, and pieces of wood that composed
it, high into the air. General Putnam, with many other
officers, stood on the shore, spectators of this explosion.</p>

<p>"In a few days, the American army evacuated New York,
and the machine was taken up the North river. Another
attempt was afterwards made by Lee, upon a frigate that
lay opposite Bloomingsdale. His object now was to fasten the
magazine to the stern of the ship, close at the water's edge.
But while attempting this, the watch discovered him, raised
an alarm, and compelled him to abandon his enterprize. He
then endeavoured to get under the frigate's bottom; but in
this he failed, having descended too deep. This terminated
his experiments."</p>

<p>With regard to diving bells, several machines, for the
purpose of descending under water, &amp;c. have been invented.
Some experiments have been made by the French with similar
contrivances, without any adequate result; and the difficulty
of carrying them into execution, in real practice, will
prevent their introduction.</p>

<p>Dr. <i>Caustic</i>, (<cite>Terrible Tractoration</cite>, p. 65), in a note, in
reference to Bushnel's invention, observes, that if you consult
the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society,
"you will see what Mr. D. Bushnel, of Connecticut, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
done, and had like to have done, by virtue of submarine explosions.
You will find, that several English ships have
been put in jeopardy, and one schooner actually blown up
and demolished by Mr. Bushnel's submarine explosions."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXI. Of the Torpedo.</i></p>

<p>The late Mr. Fulton applied himself to the improvement
of the <i>Turtle</i> during the late war, and brought it to such perfection,
that if it came in contact with a ship's bottom, it
would inevitably blow up the vessel. From the account we
have given of the turtle, we may readily imagine the construction
of the torpedo. These were of several kinds; some (or
rather the magazine attached to them,) were designed to be
screwed under the bottom, and others to explode by coming
in contact with the vessel, or any resisting body. The
time of explosion was so determined, by clock-work machinery,
in the manner of Bushnel's contrivance that it would
invariably explode at the minute or second required.</p>

<p>Mr. Fulton wrote a number of essays on this torpedo, and
other contrivances for annoying the enemy, such as the harpoon,
&amp;c. The torpedo, at which the British ships, stationed on
our coast, were so much alarmed, is in fact a powerful weapon
of destruction. It is to be observed, that the magazine,
accompanying the <i>bell</i>, in some instances, was detached; so
that the latter was removed out of danger, when the former
was fixed to the ship's bottom. In order to prevent the torpedo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
from floating against the sides of a vessel, the precaution of
having netting spread at some considerable distance round
the vessel, and of keeping up a constant guard of boats, which
were rowed round the ship both day and night, was used.
Not having the writings of Mr. Fulton before us, we can
give no precise description of his improvements. They are
described to be an apparatus, of which the principal piece
is a copper box, and prepared with an interior spring, which
sets fire to the powder; at the same time that the whole is
enclosed in a covering of cork, or some other light wood, to
make the torpedo float under the surface of the water.</p>

<p>It will be sufficient to remark, that <i>they</i> have produced the
<i>effect</i> of causing a constant, and, in our opinion, painful anxiety
to the British. Of this we have abundant proof. We
may add, however, the result of some of the experiments,
by which it will appear, that they are eminently calculated,
like the infernal machine, to produce death and destruction.</p>

<p>In consequence of some essays, published by Mr. Fulton,
on the practicability of destroying ships by torpedoes, several
persons turned their attention to this subject; among whom
was a Mr. Mix of the navy. Mr. Mix's intention was to destroy
the ship of war Plantagenet, of 74 guns, lying in Lynnhaven
bay. Having made a torpedo, Mr. Mix, accompanied
by two gentlemen, one of whom was a midshipman, proceeded
in a boat, on the night of the 24th of July, 1813, and,
having reached within 100 yards of the ship, dropped the
torpedo. It was swept along by the side, but exploded a few
seconds before it would have come in contact with the vessel.
It produced, however, great consternation and confusion
on board the vessel, and induced several of the crew to take
to their boats. The ship was greatly agitated, and some damage
done by the violent motion of the water. The noise,
occasioned by the explosion, was loud and tremendous; and
the appearance of the water, thrown up in a column of thirty
or forty feet high, awfully sublime. It has not been ascertained,
that any lives were lost.</p>

<p>The case of a Mr. Penny, of Easthampton, Long Island,
is connected with the subject of torpedoes. He was carried
on board the Ramilies, and put in irons; because his name
had been entered on the books of one of the frigates, as having
been "<i>employed in a boat, contrived for the purpose, under
the command of Thomas Welling, prepared with a torpedo,
to destroy this</i> (Capt. Hardy's) <i>ship</i>."</p>

<p>The affair of Stonington, also, shows, that the British were
determined to punish the inhabitants for having, as captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
Hardy expresses it, prepared torpedoes; and the captain stated,
in his reply to the deputation from the town, that the
bombardment should cease, in case the inhabitants would engage
that no <i>torpedoes</i> should be fitted out by them. No torpedoes,
however, were fitted out at Stonington.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Fulton made a number of experiments with the torpedo,
in the harbour of New York; and one vessel was completely
cut in two. These experiments were very satisfactory
to all who witnessed them.</p>

<p>The greatest difficulty he experienced was in giving them
a proper direction, so as to hit the vessel intended to be destroyed.
This he acknowledged to a friend, professor Eaton,
of Troy, who informed us of the fact. He entertained no
doubt whatever of the effect of the torpedo, when once
brought in contact with a vessel.</p>

<p>At Havre, in France, Mr. Fulton constructed a sub-marine
boat, sufficient to contain several men, and air for eight
hours, and strong enough to bear submersion to the depth of
one hundred feet, if necessary. In this boat, he remained
an hour under water, made half a league of way in that
time, with his boat horizontally situated, and at various
depths, where he found that the compass traversed exactly,
as on the surface. To the boat he attached a machine, by
means of which he blew up a lighter in Brest Harbour.</p>

<p>While in France, in the time of the Republic, Mr. F. directed
his attention to this subject. His <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bateau-poisson</i>, described
in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire de l'Industrie</cite>, vol. i, p. 265, is of
the same character. A number of experiments performed
with it are given.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXII. Of the Marine Incendiary Kegs, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>We purpose to notice, under this head, two contrivances,
which have been used, the one in the revolution, and the
other, during the late war with Great Britain.</p>

<p>The piece of poetry, called the <i>Battle of the Kegs</i>, written
by the late Francis Hopkinson, Esq. of Philadelphia, narrating
the incendiary kegs, is founded on this contrivance.</p>

<p>For the purpose of destroying the shipping at Philadelphia,
which was then in possession of the British, some forty
or more kegs were fitted up at Burlington, N. J. or in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
neighbourhood, containing a quantity of gunpowder. These
kegs were connected in such a manner, that, while they
formed one float, when one exploded, the whole would go
off. This arrangement was also made with another, if our
information is correct, which consisted in a trigger connected
with a gun-lock, (one or more kegs having the same); so
that, when the triggers went off, by the casks coming against
any thing, in floating down the tide, the whole would explode
at the same time. There is one of the original kegs in
the magazine of Fort Mifflin. We apprehend, however,
that the contrivance was more like that of clock-work, set to
a given time, like the torpedo of Fulton; but of this we have
no certain account. These kegs were towed down the river,
within a mile or two of the city, and were seen about
sunrise opposite to it. They did no execution; but, if they
had been taken to a given spot, instead of being left to the
direction of the running current, and then properly adjusted,
no doubt the effect would have been as the contriver calculated.
It excited, however, no small sensation at the time.</p>

<p>Of the other contrivance, we have the following account:
A Mr. Scudder (<cite>History of the late War, &amp;c.</cite> p. 187) formed
a design of destroying the British ship Ramilies, of 74 guns,
off New London. For this purpose, 10 kegs of powder were
put into a strong cask, with a quantity of sulphur mixed into
it. At the head of the cask were, fixed two gun-locks,
with cords fastened to the triggers, and to the under side of
the barrels in the hatchway; so that it was impossible to
hoist the barrels, without springing the locks each side of
the powder. On the top were placed a quantity of turpentine
and spirits of turpentine, which in all probability were
sufficient to destroy any vessel that ever floated. These
kegs were put on board the smack Eagle, which sailed from
New York on the 15th of June, for New London; but
which the crew abandoned, on being pursued by the boats of
the enemy. It was expected, that the vessel would be brought
alongside the Ramilies, and, by exploding, destroy that ship.
The wind dying away, and the tide being against them, she
could not, very fortunately for the enemy, be brought alongside.
When the Eagle exploded, there were four boats alongside,
and a great many men on board of her. After the
explosion, there was not a vestige of the boats to be seen.
A body of fire rose to a vast height, and then burst like a
rocket. Every man, near or about her, was probably lost,
as the boats sent from the Ramilies were seen to return without
picking up anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span></p>

<p>In relation to similar enterprizes, what could have been a
more daring and hazardous enterprize, than that of lieutenants
Wadsworth, Summers, &amp;c. who, by a previous agreement,
determined, if they were likely to be captured by the
Turks, to blow themselves up in the fire-ship, which they
had prepared to destroy the enemy's shipping, in the harbour
of Tripoli? Their fate is too well known, lamentable
as it is!</p>

<p>The marquis of Worcester, in his <cite>Century of Inventions</cite>,
inventions nine and ten, speaks of certain contrivances for
the destruction of vessels, which seem to have been of the
kind mentioned: <i>viz.</i> "An engine, portable in one's pocket,
which may be carried and fastened on the inside of the
greatest ship, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tanquam aliud agens</i>; and, at an appointed
minute, though a week after, either of a day or night, it
shall irrecoverably sink that ship;" and "a way from a mile
off, to drive and fasten a like engine to any ship, so as it may
punctually work the same effect, either for time or execution."</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXIII. Of Sea Lights.</i></p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fanaux de mer</i>, or sea lights, are so called, from the
particular application of this fire.</p>

<p>It is sometimes required at sea to throw light upon the
water, and around the vessel, in order to perceive the approach
of an enemy. This is effected by the composition for
sea lights.</p>

<p>A tube must be formed of not less than three inches in
diameter, and eleven inches in length. A shield is then
adapted, of four times the exterior diameter of the tube or
case, which shield is to be made of wood, and attached at
about the distance of one-fourth of the length of the tube,
and near the end of the orifice.</p>

<p>The case or tube is then charged with the following composition:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Composition for Sea Lights.</i></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">

<p class="p1">The tube, which may be made of iron, pasteboard, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
wood, by boring it out, after being charged, is primed in the
usual manner, inserting in the end, at the same time, a piece
of quick-match. When dried, it is wrapped in paper for
better preservation.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXIV. Of Signal and War-Rockets.</i></p>

<p>Rockets, we have said, are cylindrical cases, formed generally
of pasteboard, and filled with a peculiar composition,
made of meal-powder, saltpetre, sulphur, and charcoal; or
without powder, and sometimes with the addition of pulverized
cast iron. In some, as the Congreve rocket, iron cases
are substituted for those of paper. The outer diameter is
usually from one and a half to two inches, the length of the
charge five diameters, and the interior diameter two-thirds
as much as the exterior. The tools necessary are, a rod or
former of wood, to mould the case upon; an artificer's tool to
roll the paper close; a conical spit or piercer, by means of
which the rocket when loaded has a hollow through the middle,
which piercer should be four and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'two-third'">two-thirds</ins> times as long
as the outer diameter of the rocket, one-third of this diameter
at the base, and one-sixth at the small end; three rods for
loading, having a conical aperture to receive the piercer, and
one massive; and a ladle or measure, whose diameter is
equal to that of the inside of the rocket, and its length three
times as much. The construction of the cartouch case, or
paper cylinder, consists in using pasteboard of three or more
thicknesses, which is rolled on the former, until the case becomes
sufficiently thick. The choaking of the cylinder is
performed by means of a cord, of three lines in diameter,
one end of which is firmly fixed into a wall, and the other
tied to a stick, against which the artificer who bestrides the
cord rests. The rocket is loaded or charged, by introducing
at a time, a ladle full of composition, first fixing the case
over the piercer, and using the appropriate rammer and mallet,
in the manner stated, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Signal rockets are sometimes <i>trimmed</i> with serpents, stars,
and petards. The serpents are made of cases in the manner
already mentioned; <i>viz.</i> by rolling playing cards in the direction
of their length, upon a former, three lines in diameter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
and covered with three coats of paper, the last of which is
pasted. The cases are choaked at one end, and in the niche
is placed a strand of tow, and a priming of meal-powder,
moistened with brandy. They are loaded, by means of a
rod, three-fourths full of the composition, and again choaked
at half their height. The remainder is filled up with powder,
to make a report. If a serpent with stars is to be made,
only half the case is filled with the serpent-composition, and
the rest with that for stars. Serpents are placed upright in
the pot, the priming down.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Composition for Serpents, for trimming Signal Rockets.</i></p>

<p class="p1">The star composition is the same as before given.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> It is
mixed and made into balls or cubes, in the same manner.
The petards or crackers are small cubes of paper, filled with
grained gunpowder. They are wrapped with two layers of
good thread, which is drawn tight in every direction. They
are dipped in tar to give them more consistence, and pierced
and primed with quick match. We have already given the
theory of the flight of rockets in the first part of this work;
and also the opinions of Mariotte and Dr. Desaguliers. On
this head, therefore, further observation seems unnecessary
We have said, however, that it is necessary, for giving the
rocket a sufficient degree of motion, that the powder within
the rocket be bored with a tapering cavity from the choke,
and at the choke this cavity must be as wide as the choke itself,
and at the further end, not more than half that width.
The length of this bore must be but one inner diameter of
the rocket, short of the whole height to which the rocket is
rammed. The use of this bore, it is to be observed, is to
increase the surface, that takes fire at once; that a greater
body of fire may issue out of the mouth of the rocket. From
the vehemence with which the fire issues out, the rocket receives
its motion. We have seen, that rockets are used in
all fire-works that have motion; for cases charged give motion
to wheels of various kinds, and act on the same principle.
Such works as are thrown into the air after the manner
of bombs, are, however, an exception.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span></p>

<p>The rocket-stick is a necessary appendage. When very
heavy, to prevent mischief by their fall, they now bore the
sticks, and fill them with powder, that they may shiver in the
air before they fall.</p>

<p>That the stick keeps the rocket perpendicular is obvious.
If the rocket should begin to tumble, moving round a point
in the choke, as being the common centre of gravity of rocket
and stick, there would be so much friction against the air,
by the stick between the centre and the point, and the point
would beat against the air with so much velocity, that the
reaction of the medium would restore it to its perpendicularity.
When the composition is burnt out, and the impulse
upwards has ceased, the common centre of gravity is brought
lower towards the middle of the stick. Hence the velocity
of the point of the stick is decreased, and that of the point
of the rocket increased; so that the whole will tumble down,
with the rocket end foremost. During the combustion of the
rocket, the common centre of gravity is shifting and getting
downwards, and faster and lower as the stick is lighter.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Philosophical Transactions</cite>, (vol. xlvi, p. 578) and
Robins's <cite>Mathematical Tracts</cite>, (vol. i, p. 317, &amp;c.) are sundry
experiments, and observations concerning the flight of
rockets; and as these experiments appertain more to military
purposes, the following extracts may, on that account, be
useful.</p>

<p>Mr. Robins, considering the great use that may be made
of rockets, in determining the position of distant places, and
in giving signals for naval and military purposes, procured
some, with a view of ascertaining the height to which they
rise, and the distance at which they may be seen. The
greatest part of them did not rise to above four hundred
yards; one to about five hundred; and one to six hundred
yards nearly. The greatest distance at which these were
observed, was from thirty-five to thirty-eight miles. Others
were fired at a different time, one of which rose to six hundred
and ninety yards; and it was observed, that the largest,
which were about two and a half inches in diameter, rose the
highest. In some subsequent experiments, conducted by
Mr. Da Costa, Mr. Banks, &amp;c. it was found, that, of two
rockets, of about three and a half inches in diameter, one
rose to about eight hundred and thirty-three, and the other
to 915 yards. In another trial, a rocket of four inches in
diameter rose to one thousand one hundred and ninety
yards. In other experiments, a rocket of one and a half inches
rose to seven hundred and forty-three yards; one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
two inches to six hundred and fifty nine; one of two and a
half inches to eight hundred and eighty; another of the same
size to one thousand and seventy-one; one of three inches to
one thousand two hundred and fifty-four; one of three and a
half inches to one thousand one hundred and nine; and one of
four inches rose to seven hundred yards, and, turning, fell
to the ground before it went out. Besides these, there was
one of the rockets of "twenty-four inches in diameter,"<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
which rose to seven hundred and eighty four yards, and
another of the same size, to eight hundred and thirty-three
yards. From these experiments, it is inferred, that rockets
from two and a half to three and a half inches in diameter,
are sufficient to answer all the purposes for which they are
intended; and they may be made to rise to a height, and to
afford a light capable of being seen to considerably greater
distances than those just mentioned.</p>

<p>Before we mention the war-rockets of Congreve, it may
not be improper to speak of the Indian rockets, which are
used by the native troops of India, and which were employed
against the British, with great effect, during the seige of Seringapatam
in 1799. These rockets are made of iron, and are
lashed to a bamboo cane. The weight is seldom more than
two pounds, or less than one. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fougette</i>, or Indian rocket,
resembles in shape a sky-rocket, <i>whose flight is gradually
brought to run along a horizontal direction</i>. By throwing
several fougettes into parks of artillery, and upon caissons,
&amp;c. considerable damage might be occasioned from the fire,
which would inevitably be communicated to some part. A
fougette forces itself immediately forward, cuts as it penetrates,
by the formation of its sides, which are filled with
small spikes, becomes combustible, and on fire at all its
points, and possesses within itself a thousand different means,
by which it can adhere to whatever object it is destined to
set on fire or destroy. A French writer even asserts, that
this weapon would be more effectual, because it might be
more variously applied, to defend the mouth of a harbour
against an enemy's shipping, than red-hot balls can ever
prove; and we are also told, that, by means of their natural
velocity, they would do more execution, in a less space of
time, than the most active piece of ordnance could effect; and
they would also require fewer hands, as the only necessary
operation would be to light and dart them forward.</p>

<p>The fougette, called also in French the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Baguette à feu</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
has received improvements in France, which we will notice
hereafter. In favour of these improvements and their application,
we are told, that, to do execution at a distance, especially
in sea-fights, fougettes may be so made as that they
may reach shipping at a great distance, and with a given
velocity.</p>

<p><a name="CROx" id="CROx"></a>The Congreve rocket is a new species of war-rocket, invented
by Sir William Congreve. This incendiary rocket
drew the attention of the European nations, after the attack
of the British on Copenhagen; where, we are informed, they
did incredible execution. This rocket may be considered to
be a carrier of fire. Their effect, however, in the Chesapeake,
and elsewhere, during the late war, was very trifling.
They seemed, in fact, little calculated to injure and more to
intimidate.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> They differ from the common rocket as well
in their magnitude and construction, as in the powerful nature
of their composition; which is such, that without the encumbrance
of any ordnance, (the rocket containing the propelling
power wholly within itself), balls, shells, case-shot
and carcasses, may be projected to the distance of one thousand
to three thousand yards. The principle of projectile
force is so greatly increased, as not only to triple the flight of
small rockets so formed, but also to allow of the construction
of rockets of such dimensions, as, on the ordinary principles
of combination, would not even rise from the ground, and of
such powers of flight and burthen, as have hitherto been considered
altogether impracticable.</p>

<p>On the basis of this increase of power, Congreve has succeeded
in making this rocket. They are formed of various
dimensions, as well in length as in caliber, and are differently
armed, according as they are intended for the field, or for
bombardment and conflagration; carrying in the first instance
either shells or case shot, and in the second, for the
purpose of destroying shipping, buildings, stores, &amp;c. a peculiar
species of composition, which never fails of destroying
every combustible material with which it comes in contact.
The latter are called <i>carcass-rockets</i>, and were first used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
at Boulogne in 1805, after many experiments, which were
made by Congreve, at Woolwich. The attack in 1806 was
merely desultory, in which not more than 200 rockets were
fired. The town was set on fire by the first discharge, and
continued burning for near two days. After the affair at Copenhagen,
which established their reputation, it appears that
a committee of officers, who had witnessed their effect in
that bombardment, pronounced them to be "<i>a powerful auxiliary
to the present system of artillery.</i>"</p>

<p>At the seige of Flushing, they appear to have been used
with success, and general Monnet, the French commandant,
made a formal remonstrance to lord Chatham respecting the
use of them in that bombardment. The rocket system was
also tried with success, and the crown prince of Sweden was
the first general, who bore testimony to their effects in this
service. At the memorable battle of Leipzig, they proved,
we are informed, a powerful weapon, and also, when the
British army under Wellington, crossed the Adour. In 1814,
a rocket-corps was established in the British service.</p>

<p>General de Grave transmitted, to the Society of Encouragement
of Paris, a Congreve rocket, or an English incendiary
rocket, which was found on the French coast. M.
Gay-Lussac examined it. The case was made with gray
paper, and painted. The inflammable matter was of a yellowish-gray,
and the sulphur was distinguishable with the
naked eye. It burnt with a quick flame, and exhaled sulphurous
acid gas.</p>

<p>According to his analysis, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives des Découvertes</cite>, ii,
303), the composition gave</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">

</table>

<p class="p1">Gay-Lussac, after determining the proportions of the constituent
parts, made a composition of a similar kind, and
charged a case, which exhibited the same properties as the
English rocket.</p>

<p>The great general point of excellence of the rocket system,
if we may judge from the account of English writers, is the
facility with which all the natures of this weapon may be
conveyed and applied. Its peculiar applicability to naval
bombardment is said to rest on this property, that there is
no reaction, no recoil in the firing of the largest rocket; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
that by this means carcasses, equal to those projected by the
largest mortars, may be thrown from the smallest boats. Its
peculiar fitness for land service is, that it is a description of
extremely powerful ammunition without ordnance, so that
the burthen of mortars and guns is dispensed with, and all
that is to be carried is actual available missile matter, capable
of range, and of many of the most important effects of
the heaviest artillery. The rocket system, as a system of ammunition
without ordnance, is highly extolled by British
writers.</p>

<p>We will now speak of their construction. All rockets designed
for service are cylindrical, having strong metallic cases,
and armed, as we before observed, either with carcass composition
for bombardment and conflagration, or with shells
and case shot for field service. They are, however, of various
weights and dimensions, from the eight-inch carcass or
explosion rocket, weighing nearly three hundred weight, to
the six pound shell rocket, which is the smallest size, used in
the field. The sticks, which are employed for regulating
their flight, are also of different lengths, according to the
size and service of the rocket; and which, for the convenience
of carriage, are stowed apart from the rocket, and so
contrived as to consist of two or more parts, which are connected
to it, and to each other, when requisite, with the utmost
expedition. The 32 pounder rocket carcass, which is
the nature hitherto chiefly used for bombardment, will range
3000 yards with the same quantity of combustible matter as
that contained in the 10 inch spherical carcass, and 2500 yards
with the same quantity as that of the 13 inch spherical carcass.
The 12 pounder rocket case shot, which is so portable
that it may be used with the facility of musketry, has a
range nearly double that of field artillery, carrying as many
bullets as the 6 pounder spherical case. We may remark
here, that the projectile force of the rocket is well calculated
for the conveyance of case shot to great distances; because,
as it proceeds, its velocity is accelerated instead of being retarded,
as happens with any other projectile; while the average
velocity of the shell is greater than that of the rocket
only in the ratio of 9 to 8. Independent of this, the case
shot conveyed by the rocket admits of any desired increase
of velocity in its range by the bursting of powder, which
cannot be obtained in any other description of case.</p>

<p>Rocket ammunition is divided into three classes, <i>heavy</i>,
<i>medium</i>, and <i>light</i>; the former including all those above 42
lbs., which are denominated according to their caliber, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
eight-inch, seven-inch, &amp;c. rockets; the medium including
all those from 42 lbs. to 24 lbs.; and the light embracing from
18 pounder to 6 pounder inclusive.</p>

<p>The carcass-rockets are armed with strong iron conical
heads, containing a composition as hard and solid as iron itself,
and which, when once inflamed, cannot be extinguished.
A 32 pounder carcass rocket will penetrate 9 feet in common
ground. They have been known to pierce through several
floors, and through the sides of houses. For field service,
the 24, 18, 12, and 6 pounders are commonly used. The
ranges of the eight-inch, seven-inch, and six-inch rockets,
are from 2000 to 2500 yards, and the quantity of combustible
matter, or bursting powder, from 25 lbs. to 50 lbs.
These sized rockets are equally efficient for the destruction
of bomb proofs, or the demolition of strong buildings. The
largest rocket that has yet been constructed has not exceeded
300 weight. It is proposed, however, to make them from
half a ton to a ton in weight.</p>

<p>The 42 and 32 pounders, which are used in bombardment,
will convey from 7 lbs. to 10 lbs. of combustible matter each,
and have a range of upwards of 3000 yards. The 24 pounder
is equal to the propelling of the coehorn shell, or 12 pounder
shot. It is, from the saving in weight, generally preferred
to the 32 pounder. The eighteen-pounder, which is the
first of the light nature of rockets, is armed with a nine
pound shot or shell; the twelve-pounder, with a six do.; the
nine-pounder, with a grenade; and the six-pounder, with a
3 lb. shot or shell.</p>

<p class="p1">From the preceding table, it will be seen, that the 32 pounder
carcass rocket will range 3000 yards, with the same quantity
of combustible matter as that contained in a ten-inch
spherical case, and 2500 yards, with the same quantity as
that of the thirteen-inch spherical carcass. The twelve
pounder case-shot rocket, which is so portable that it may be
used with the facility of musquetry, has a range nearly double
that of field artillery, carrying as many bullets as the six
pounder spherical case: add to which, that, from the nature
of the combination of the rocket, these bullets are projected
from it in any part of its track, with an increase of velocity,
by which its operation becomes frequently more destructive
at that point, where any different species of ammunition
ceases to be effective. Of this description of rocket-case-shot,
one hundred soldiers will carry into action, in any situation
where musquetry can act, 300 rounds, and 10 frames
for discharging them; from each of which, four rounds may
be fired in a minute. Of the same description of case-shot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
four horses will carry 72 rounds, and four frames; from
which may be fired 16 rounds in a minute. The rockets
used by cavalry are twelve pounders, armed with a 6 pounder
shell or case shot; each horse carrying four of these rockets.
To detail the arrangement of the rocket corps, the
weight of ammunition carried by the troop horse, and other
particulars, would require more space than we can conveniently
appropriate to these subjects.</p>

<p>We may remark, however, that the heavier species of
rockets, as the 32 pounder or 24 pounder, as also the 18 and
12 pounders, are sometimes carried in cars of a peculiar description;
which not only convey the ammunition, but are
contrived also to discharge each two rockets in a volley, from a
double iron-plate trough. This trough is of the same length as
the boxes for the sticks, and travels between them; but being
moveable, may, when the car is unlimbered, be shifted
into its fighting position, at any angle from the ground
ranges, or point blank, up to 45°, without being detached
from the carriage. The limbers are always in the rear. The
rockets are fired with a port-fire and long stick.</p>

<p>When used by infantry, one man in ten, carries a frame of
a very simple construction, standing on three legs like a theodolite,
when spread. It is mounted at top with an open
cradle, from which the rockets are discharged, either for
ground ranges, or at any required elevation.</p>

<p>When they are used for bombardment, they are discharged
from frames of a different, though simple, construction;
and, in many cases, the frames are dispensed with, as
they are thrown from a battery, erected for the purpose.</p>

<p>For the defence of a pass, or for covering the retreat of
an army, the rockets are laid in batteries of 100 or 500 in a
row, according to the extent of the ground to be protected.
One man may fire the whole.</p>

<p>With regard to their use in the naval service, some additional
remarks may be interesting.</p>

<p>We observed, that, in consequence of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'their being'">there being</ins> no reaction
in these projectiles on the point of discharge, rockets
may be used in the smallest boats of the navy. These
rockets carry a quantity of combustible matter, and, according
to the ordinary system, would require to be thrown from
the largest mortars, and from ships of very heavy tonnage.
The 12 and 18 pounder have been fired from a four-oared
gig. They may be made to <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'richochet'">ricochet</ins> in the water at low
angles. In boarding, they have been recommended, to be
thrown into the port holes of the enemy. They have also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
been recommended for fire-ships, in order to produce an extensive
and devastating fire among the ships of the enemy.</p>

<p>Besides the advantages, which rockets possess, and of
which we have spoken; namely, that it is a species of projectile,
containing within itself the propelling power, by
which heavy ordnance is dispensed with, and that an extensive
fire may be kept up, by a few men, against any important
point; there is another advantage said to be peculiar to
them; <i>viz.</i> that they may be employed in a variety of cases,
in which the usual artillery, from the nature of the ground,
or other impediments, cannot be rendered effective; and that,
in several bombardments, in consequence of their trifling reaction,
they may be thrown from cutters and small boats, and,
therefore, from points, which could never be approached by
the vessels, usually employed in that service. With respect
to the expense of the formation of war-rockets, calculations
have been made, by which it appears, that their cost is less
than the usual expense of carcasses.</p>

<p>We are informed on this head, that it is the cheapest of
all ammunition, depending on the projectile force of gunpowder.
For a 32 pounder carcass rocket costs only 1<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>
complete for service, and its equivalent, the 10 inch spherical
carcass, with the charge of powder necessary to convey it
3000 yards, which power is contained in the rocket, costs
1<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>, independent of any charge for the mortar, mortar
bed, platform, difference of transport, &amp;c. A vessel of 300
tons will carry 5000 of them at least. But the comparison,
as to the expense, is still more in favour of the rocket, when
compared with the larger nature of carcasses. The 15 inch
spherical carcass costs 1<i>l.</i> 17<i>s.</i> 11<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span><i>d.</i> to throw 2500 yards;
while its equivalent rocket costs but 1<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> being a saving on
the first cost, of 12<i>s.</i> 11<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span><i>d.</i></p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the encomiums, bestowed on the Congreve
rockets by the English, the French entertain a different
opinion of them. For the following remarks, we are indebted
to Ruggeri, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pyrotechnie Militaire</cite>, p. 278), by which
it appears, that Congreve was not the original inventor. He
acknowledges, however, that they experienced the sad effects
of them; and we do not offer this remark with any sort of
prejudice, but as an acknowledgment, that the French experienced
their "sad effects." Ruggeri says, that the Congreve
rocket is nothing more than he described in his <cite>Elements
of Pyrotechny</cite> five years before they were known to
the English. It is, therefore, wrong, he adds, that we regard
it as an English invention. It was invented, says he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
by a naval officer at Bordeaux, and ought not, he further
remarks, to be regarded as a useful weapon in war. The
reason he gives is, that its utility must depend upon
places and circumstances. If it is required, he adds, to
attack a fleet, we must employ two or three hundred before
making any impression; because we cannot direct a firing
rocket, as a cannon or ball. This is certainly a great inconvenience.
He makes the cost also much greater than the
English calculation; namely, for a single one of them ten
times more than for a red-hot shot. Ruggeri, however, is
candid enough to say, that, notwithstanding he differs in opinion,
he is far from opposing any trials or experiments, made
with the view of improving or perfecting it; but is decidedly
of opinion, that it can never be employed at sea with the
same advantage as bombs and cannon-ball.</p>

<p>Ruggeri published, in the <cite>Journal of Paris</cite>, in September,
1809, a letter, in reply to a writer, who had published some
reflections on incendiary rockets, from which, as it throws
some light on this subject, we shall here introduce a few extracts:</p>

<p>"Although Monsieur, the <i>cannonier</i> of Ostend, may not
have given the precise construction of the rocket, which we
name the sky-rocket, and of which the English have made so
criminal a use, I will commence at first by assuring you, that
I coincide perfectly with him, in the preference he gives to
howitzes, bombs, and other projectiles, which are used by
civilized nations. He has very satisfactorily demonstrated
their advantages over the Congreve rocket. I will only
add, that bombs and howitzes have also the advantage of
being one-fifth cheaper, and projected with greater facility.</p>

<p>"The Congreve rocket cannot be of any particular advantage,
because it only carries fire to the place where it
falls; and if we wish to use them against any vessel whatever,
it is impossible to assure ourselves of a direction on a
given point, as many difficulties occur in projecting them.</p>

<p>"The merit of the invention of these rockets does not
belong to the English.</p>

<p>"This invention was made by a Frenchman, a captain of
a privateer, who made the first attempt to use them about
seventeen years since, (1795).</p>

<p>"The English have perfected, or rather have modified
this rocket.</p>

<p>"It is sometime since I offered a kind of bomb, which
may be used with more facility than the common kind. This
bomb has the advantage over the Congreve rocket: 1st,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
Because it is less troublesome to use; 2dly, It may be made
of any diameter or size, and consequently suited to all calibers;
3dly, The place and time of its fall is readily determined;
and fourth, and lastly, It bursts into pieces, and attaches
itself to all combustible bodies, with which it meets.</p>

<p>"It remains for me to say, that it is not the powder which
moves the rocket, but a composition almost as strong. The
powder, which is used in the Congreve rocket, is intended
to destroy the machine after it has produced its destructive
effects." See <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pyrotechnie Militaire</cite>, p. 278.</p>

<p>The difference between incendiary rockets, and common
signal rockets, is in the interior. Instead of the furniture, or
garnishing pot and head, a conical head of sheet iron is substituted,
in which several holes are made to suffer the composition
it contains to burn more readily. The composition
is the same as that for fire-rockets; but is coarsely pulverized,
and mixed with an equal quantity of the composition of
fire-lances. These rockets are employed with advantage to
burn a city, or vessels in a harbour. The cone, with which
they are capped, enables them to penetrate the roofs of houses,
and set them on fire.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXV. Sky-Rockets (Meurtrières.)</i></p>

<p>The sanguinary or <i>murdering rocket</i> is made in the same
manner as the preceding. They have neither head nor pot;
but, in their place, they are furnished with a cone of beaten
or solid iron. This cone is the appendage, or weapon,
which produces such destructive effects. These rockets,
when they fall upon the troops of an enemy, wound them
very dangerously, without their being able to prevent it.
The advantage, more particularly derived, is, that they may
be projected from under cover, and to double the distance of
ordinary musketry. To make use of these rockets, a box is
constructed, whose interior is so arranged as to receive the
rockets in regular order. They should be placed in it with
their sticks; and, therefore, the case must be made sufficiently
large to admit them. By this contrivance, the rockets
are sheltered from the fire and water. To discharge them,
the box is first inclined on the side next to the heads of the
rockets, and in the direction of the place, to which they are
to be thrown. A communication is made by leaders, in the
manner already mentioned in the preceding part of this work;
so that, when the match is fired, or a single rocket, they all
are discharged at the same time. The mode of firing rockets
either singly or in numbers, the manner of preparing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
cases, the different compositions, and the operation of filling,
and of furnishing them, &amp;c. are given in the preceding part.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXVI. Of the Rocket Light-Ball.</i></p>

<p>Congreve also invented a species of light-ball, which,
when thrown into the air by means of one of his rockets, and
having reached the elevation of the rockets' ascent, is detached
from it with an explosion, and remains suspended in the
air by a small parachute, to which it is connected by a chain.
Thus, in lieu of the transient momentary gleam, obtained by
the common light ball, a permanent and brilliant light is obtained,
and suspended in the air for five minutes at least, so
as to afford time and light sufficient to observe the motions
of an enemy, either on shore or at sea; where it is particularly
useful in chasing, and for giving distant and more extensive
night signals. It is to be observed, that nothing of this kind
can be obtained by the projectile force of either guns or
mortars; because the explosion infallibly destroys any construction,
that could be made to produce the suspension in
the air.</p>

<p>We have seen no account of any experiments, which have
been made with it.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXVII. Of the Floating Rocket Carcass.</i></p>

<p>Congreve also applied his rocket, and the parachute, for
the purpose of conveying combustible matter to distances far
beyond the range of any known projectile force, at the same
time that it is cheap, simple, and portable. The floating carcass,
like the light-ball, is thrown into the air, attached to a
rocket, from which being liberated at its greatest altitude,
and suspended to a small parachute, it is driven forward by
the wind, and will, in a moderate breeze, afford ranges at
least double those of the common carcass. It may, therefore,
for naval purposes, be thrown from a blockading squadron,
in great quantities, by a fair wind, against any fleet or arsenal,
without the smallest risk, or without approaching within
range of either guns or mortars. The rocket containing the
carcass is no larger than the 32 pounder carcass rocket; and
the whole expense, added to the rocket, does not exceed five
shillings. Nor are the approaches of the carcass itself necessarily
visible by night; as it may be so arranged, as not to
inflame, till some time after it has settled. It is evidently,
therefore, capable of becoming a harassing weapon, if the account
of it be true; and, among large fleets and flotillas, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
may do as much injury as any other carcass, by lodging unperceived
in the rigging, or lighting on extensive arsenals, in
such situations, where other means of annoyance could not
be used.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXVIII. Observations on Rockets.</i></p>

<p>The following remarks on the subject of rockets by M.
Bigot, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité d'Artifice de Guerre</cite>, p. 131,) may be interesting
to the reader.</p>

<p>Authors, who have written on rockets, are of opinion,
that the height of the different kinds of rockets should not
be increased on account of their diameter; because, as the
diameter increases, the rocket also increases in weight and
surface; and if augmented in height in the same ratio, its
power of ascension would be feeble. It is from this reasoning,
together with practice, that they have determined the
height of empty cases. Some have given the proportion of
six times their exterior diameter, and others again have made
them a third longer than the piercer. There has resulted
from this difference of opinion, such an irregularity in the
formation of rockets, that artificers or fire-workers were left
in uncertainty as to the best mode to be pursued. To avoid,
however, this embarrassment, if we consider the diameter
of the base of the piercer of any kind of rocket as one-third
of the exterior diameter of the case, the small end must be
the one-sixth part of it; and the piercer and the cone are of
the same diameter, and the surface of the one is equal to
the surface of the other. We might conclude, accordingly,
that the increase of the height of the case, should be the same
with all kinds of rockets. It appears by different authors,
that the ancient and modern fire-workers have fixed the dimensions
of rockets and their piercers, by various experiments.
If we take for granted all the heights of the piercers,
or the rockets themselves, we obtain a curve of double or
treble reflection, which is very evidently in opposition to the
above principles, and of the law which results from them.</p>

<p>Experiments prove, that to make a good rocket of half an
inch in diameter, the piercer must be five times and a third
of the same diameter; and for a rocket of three inches, the
piercer, or broach, as it is sometimes called, is only four
times the diameter in height. To determine, however, the
height of the piercer in general, greater than the preceding,
it is found necessary to have some satisfactory result, in order
to employ, mathematically speaking, <i>less times</i> of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
exterior diameter of the rocket. The half-inch and three-inch
rocket are the extremes of an increasing arithmetical
progression; and their equivalents, 5<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span> and 4 diameters is the
extreme of a similar, but decreasing progress; but if we insert
the same number of arithmetical mean between the
two extremes of each of these two progressions, and then
continue them indifferently, the terms of the first will express
the diameter of as many different cases; and those of
the second, the height of the corresponding piercers. They
will be, for instance, in the two following proportions:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="95%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdc">÷</td><td class="tdc">&nbsp;6</td><td class="tdc">7</td><td class="tdc">8</td>
    <td class="tdc">9</td><td class="tdc">10</td><td class="tdc">11</td><td class="tdc">12</td>
    <td class="tdc">13</td><td class="tdc">14,</td><td class="tdc">&amp;c.</td><td class="tdl">&nbsp;36.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdc">÷</td><td class="tdc">&nbsp;5<span class="xs"><sup>14</sup>/<sub>45</sub></span></td><td class="tdc">5<span class="xs"><sup>12</sup>/<sub>45</sub></span></td><td class="tdc">5<span class="xs"><sup>11</sup>/<sub>45</sub></span></td>
    <td class="tdc">5<span class="xs"><sup>9</sup>/<sub>45</sub></span></td><td class="tdc">5<span class="xs"><sup>7</sup>/<sub>45</sub></span></td><td class="tdc">5<span class="xs"><sup>7</sup>/<sub>45</sub></span></td><td class="tdc">5<span class="xs"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>45</sub></span></td>
    <td class="tdc">5<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>45</sub></span></td><td class="tdc">4<span class="xs"><sup>44</sup>/<sub>45</sub></span></td><td class="tdc">&amp;c.</td><td class="tdc">4.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="p1">The first of which has unity for its common difference. It
has been found, that, by inserting in each, a mean of 29, the
height of the piercers will correspond with the superior diameter,
which is less, or regulated by their respective diameters.
Besides, as the diameters go on augmenting, the rockets
are proportionably increased in height, but only in an inverse
order, until the 58th term included, and beyond which
they decrease, until they become negative, which appears to
indicate that the term appertains to the diameter of the
rocket, and without any uncertainty.</p>

<p>It results from the intimate relation of these two progressions,
that, in stopping at the 58th term, if we bring back on
an axis as it were, the height of the piercers, we obtain a
straight instead of a curved line.</p>

<p>Bigot has given two tables relative to the construction of
rockets, and, as their use is seen by mere inspection, we
here introduce them without remark.</p>

<p>They comprehend the dimensions of rockets of different
calibers, compared with the exterior and respective diameter
of each kind; and relative to the dimensions of the tools
of sky-rockets of different calibers, and also compared with
the exterior and respective diameter of each.</p>

<p>It will be seen, on an examination of these tables, that all
the data are satisfactorily given; so that, in the construction of
rockets, the artificer will find them extremely useful, if not
absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>The principles on which these tables are founded, may be
depended on, inasmuch as M. Bigot has taken considerable
pains on that head; and, consequently, the calculations,
which follow, and the proportions, established for the construction
of rockets in general, are sufficiently conclusive.</p>

<p><br /><i>Note.</i> The rockets of two inches, and those between that and three inches, require to be beaten with four rammers, independently of that
which is solid; and also those above three inches, require five. The rolling board should be sufficiently large for the cases we wish to form; <i>viz.</i>
one of twenty-eight inches in length, and six inches in breadth for small rockets; one of thirty inches in length, and ten inches in breadth for
middlesized rockets; and one of thirty-six inches by eighteen for the largest rockets.</p>

<p><br /><i>Note.</i> The rockets of two inches, and those between that and three inches, require to be beaten with four rammers, independently of that

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXIX. Of the Succouring Rocket.</i></p>

<p>The succouring, or marine rocket, is a name given to a
rocket, which is sufficiently large to convey a small cord or
rope to some distance from a vessel, and by its means to save
the lives of persons in danger of shipwreck. Rockets for this
purpose should be at least two inches in interior diameter.
The rod should be of the same length and thickness as a
rocket of half this caliber. To this rod is tied the cord,
which must be light, and yet strong, and when the rocket is
fired, the string should be arranged loose, so that no impediment
is experienced in the flight of the rocket.</p>

<p>The applications of the succouring rocket are two in particular:
<i>viz.</i> In case a seaman should fall overboard, and in
case of shipwreck; in the former, to throw a cord to some
distance, and in the latter, to convey a cord from the ship to
the shore, should a vessel be stranded on a beach. Several
methods have been proposed for the same purpose, namely,
that of conveying a line or rope to shore, when the surf is
too high for a small boat to live in it.</p>

<p>The invention of lieut. Bell, described in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales des
Arts et Manufactures</cite>, and in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives des Découvertes</cite>, ii,
120, is designed for a similar purpose as the succouring
rocket. Mr. Bell's invention consists simply in throwing a
rope from a vessel by means of a mortar, attaching it to a
shell, in order to make a communication from a vessel in
danger to the shore. For this contrivance, he received one
hundred guineas.</p>

<p>Several experiments were made with it, which were satisfactory.</p>

<p>In the essays, published by Mr. Fulton, a contrivance of
this kind is suggested, using, however, an instrument similar
to a harpoon, to which a rope is attached. This harpoon
is thrown by a long gun. It is calculated, also, as the harpoon
for this purpose is furnished with several barbs, to
pierce and secure an enemy's vessel.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="GREx" id="GREx"></a><i>Sec. XXX. Of the Greek Fire.</i></p>

<p>It is not known precisely what the composition of the
Greek fire was. It was invented by Callinicus of Hellipolis,
a town in Syria, who used it with so much skill and effect
during a naval engagement, that he destroyed a whole fleet
belonging to the enemy, in which were embarked thirty
thousand men. It is defined to be a sort of artificial fire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
which insinuates itself beyond the surface of the sea, and
which burns with increased violence, when it mixes with
water. Its directions are contrary to the course of natural
fire; for the flames, we are told, will spread themselves downwards,
to the right or left, agreeably to the moment that is
given.</p>

<p>It was used in the year 1679, and was known and used in
1291. It was certainly liquid, and employed in many different
ways; but, chiefly, on board ships, being thrown from
large engines on the ships of the enemy. This fire was sometimes
kindled in particular vessels, which might be called
fire-ships, and which were introduced among a hostile fleet.
Sometimes it was put into jars and other vessels, which were
thrown at the enemy by means of projectile machines; and
sometimes it was squirted by soldiers from hand-engines,
or, as it appears, blown through pipes. This fire was discharged
from the fore part of ships, by a machine constructed
of copper and iron, the extremity of which resembled the
open mouth and jaws of a lion or other animal. They were
painted, and even gilded, and, it appears, were capable of projecting
the fire to a great distance.</p>

<p>Professor Beckman, who examined all the ancient authors
respecting the Greek fire, expressly says, that the machines
which the ancients employed to throw this fire were <i>spouting
engines</i>. He also observes (<cite>History of Invent.</cite> iv, p. 85)
that "John Cameniata, speaking of his native city, Thessalonica,
which was taken by the Saracens in the year 901,
says, that the enemy threw fire into the wooden works of the
besieged, which was blown into them by means of tubes,
and thrown from other vessels. This passage, which I do
not find quoted in any of the works that treat on the Greek
fire, proves, that the Greeks, in the beginning of the tenth
century, were no longer the only people acquainted with the
art of preparing this fire, the precurser of our gunpowder.
The Emperor Leo, who about the same period wrote his art
of war, recommends such engines, with a metal covering, to
be constructed in the fore part of ships; and he twice afterwards
mentions engines for throwing out Greek fire. In
the east, one may easily have conceived the idea of loading
some kind of pump with the Greek fire; as the use of a forcing
pump for extinguishing fires was long known there before
the invention of Callinicus."</p>

<p>Writers differ considerably as to the composition of Greek
fire, properly so called, as there were many preparations,
some hundred years after the discovery, which went under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
the name of Greek fire. Certain it is, that the Greeks had a
knowledge of a very highly combustible preparation, which
water would not extinguish, and which, from its nature, must
have had the property of decomposing water itself, or possessed
so much oxygen, as to support the combustion of the
inflammable substances, even in contact with water.</p>

<p>Mr. Parke, (<cite>Chem. Catechism</cite>, p. 465), speaking of some of
the uses of nitre or saltpetre, says, that "for the same purposes
it was used by the ancients in that destructive composition of
antiquity, the Greek fire. Sulphur, rosin, camphor, and
other combustibles, were melted with it, and in this melted
mass, woollen cords were dipped, which were afterwards
rolled up for use. These balls being set on fire were thrown
into the tents, &amp;c. of the enemy, and as the combustibles
were furnished with a constant supply of <i>oxygen</i> from the
nitre, nothing could extinguish them." He also observes:
"For many centuries, the method of making this dreadful
article of destruction was lost; but it has just been discovered
by the librarian of the elector of Bavaria, who has found
a very old latin manuscript, which contains directions for
preparing it."</p>

<p>It appears, however, that it could only be extinguished by
urine, sand, &amp;c. James (<cite>Mil. Dic.</cite> p. 329) says, "it is composed,
or made up of naphtha, sulphur, bitumen, gum, and
pitch, and it can only be extinguished by vinegar, mixed with
urine and sand, or with undressed leather and green hides."</p>

<p>The author of a French work, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Œuvres Militaires</cite>, says,
that a powerful composition, which is not extinguishable
with water, may be made of the following substances: <i>viz.</i>
pitch, rosin, tallow, camphor, turpentine, saltpetre, liquid
varnish, oil of sulphur, linseed, rock oil, flax, and charcoal
finely pulverized. The whole is melted together and boiled,
and before it grows cold, quicklime in powder is added. It
is said to be susceptible of the most subtile and destructive
fire.</p>

<p>Bertrandon de la Brocquiere, who was in Palestine in 1432,
as counsellor to the Duke of Burgundy, observes, that the
Moors were then in possession of the Greek fire. He was
present at Barrat, during one of the Moorish celebrations.
"It began," says he, "in the evening at sun set. Numerous
companies, scattered here and there, were singing and uttering
loud cries. While this was passing, the cannon of the
castle were fired, and the people of the town launched into
the air, '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bien hault et bien loing, une maniére de feu plus gros
fallot que je veisse oncques allume</i>.' They told me, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
made use of such at sea, to set fire to the sails of an enemy's
vessel. It seems to me, that as it is a thing easy to be
made, and at a little expense, it may be equally well employed
to burn a camp or a thatched village, or in an engagement
with cavalry, to frighten their horses.</p>

<p>"Curious to know its composition, I sent the servant of
my host to the person who made this fire, and requested him
to teach me this method. He returned for answer, that he
dared not, for that he should run great danger, were it
known; but as there is nothing a Moor will not do for money,
I offered him a ducat, which quieted his fears, and he
taught me all he knew, and even gave me the moulds in
wood, with the other ingredients, which I have brought to
France."</p>

<p>Although La Brocquiere may have brought the secret to
Europe, yet it does not appear to have been used.</p>

<p>We may justly conclude, that the present gunpowder possesses
superior advantages to the Greek fire, and some authors,
as Ruggeri, are of opinion, that the account we have
of it, that of its fire <i>descending</i>, and the like, are exaggerated.</p>

<p>Porta, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Magie Naturelle</cite>), in treating of this subject, observes,
that the Greek fire was composed of the charcoal of
willow, salt, burnt brandy, sulphur, pitch, frankincense, flax,
and camphor, and that camphor alone has the effect of burning
in water. He remarks also, that, when Constantinople
was attacked, the emperor Leon burnt the vessels, or boats,
to the number of 1800, by means of the Greek fire. The
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal des Savants</cite>, 1676, p. 148, speaks of the origin and
use of the same fire.</p>

<p>In 1249, at the siege of Damietta, the French experienced
the fatal effects of it. The <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal des Savants</cite> for 1666,
mentions a machine, which, when applied against a vessel,
communicates fire to it immediately, without injuring the
person who uses it. In the <cite>French papers</cite> for 1797, M. Chevalier
announced, that he had invented an inextinguishable
incendiary fuse, which is thrown by fire arms, and calculated
to set fire to the rigging of ships. In 1759, Dr. Dupré
published in the <cite>French Journals</cite>, that he had invented a
composition, which had the same properties and effects as
the ancient Greek fire, and that he possessed the means of
extinguishing it. An experiment was made at Versailles to
the satisfaction of all, and the secret was purchased by Louis
XV. The Rev. J. P. Coste, in 1794, laid before the French
national convention, a new invention, for the purpose of war,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
consisting of a carcass composition, which nothing could extinguish,
and which resembled in that respect the Greek fire.</p>

<p>Thevenot (<cite>Travels in the Levant</cite>), says, that in the 52d
year of the Hegira, (Anno Domini 672), Constantinople was
besieged in the reign of Constantine Prognates, by Yesid, the
son of Moavia, the first caliph of the family of the Ammiades;
when the <i>Greek</i> emperor found himself so pressed, that he
was almost reduced to despair. But the famous engineer,
Callinicus, invented a kind of <i>wild fire</i>, which would burn
under water, and by this means destroyed the whole fleet.</p>

<p>Gibbon (<cite>History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire</cite>, vol. vii, p. 282), speaks also of the Greek fire, and
observes, that the deliverance of Constantinople may be chiefly
ascribed to it. It appears, that Callinicus, the inventor,
deserted from the service of the Caliph to that of the Emperor;
and Gibbon is of opinion, that this discovery or improvement
of the military art, was fortunately reserved for
the distressful period, when the degenerate Romans of the
east were incapable of contending with the warlike enthusiasm
and youthful vigour of the Saracens. He is of opinion,
that little or no credit can be given to the Byzantine accounts,
as to the composition of this fire; although, from
their obscure and fallacious hints, it should seem that the
principal ingredient was naphtha, a liquid bitumen which
springs from the earth.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> This was mixed with sulphur, and
with the pitch, extracted from the evergreen firs, according
to the testimony of Anna Commena, (<cite>Alexid</cite>, l. xiii, p. 383),
and Leo, in the xixth chapter of his <cite>Tactics</cite>, speaks of the
new invention.</p>

<p>Gibbon describes its effects much as we have stated, viz.
that the fire was strong and obstinate, and was quickened by
water; that sand, urine, and vinegar were the only agents
that could damp its fury; that it was used for the annoyance
of the enemy, both by sea and land, in battles or in sieges,
and was either poured from the rampart in large boilers, or
lanched into red-hot balls of stone and iron, or darted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
arrows and javelins, twisted round with flax and tow, which
had deeply imbibed the inflammable oil; that, at other times,
it was deposited in fire ships, or blown through long tubes of
copper, fixed on a prow of a galley; that its composition was
kept secret at Constantinople, pretending that the knowledge
of it came from an angel to the first and greatest of the Constantines,
with a sacred injunction not to divulge it under
any pretext, &amp;c. He also observes, that, after it was kept
secret above four hundred years, and to the end of the 11th
century, the method of preparing it was stolen by the Mahometans,
who employed it against the crusaders. A knight,
it appears, who despised the swords and lances of the Saracens,
relates, with heartfelt sincerity, his own fears, at
the sight and sound of the mischievous engine, that discharged
a torrent of the Greek fire, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feu Gregeois</i>, as it is
styled by the more early of the French writers. "It came
flying through the air," says Gibbon, quoting Joinville,
(<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de St. Louis</cite>) "like a winged long tailed dragon,
about the thickness of a hogshead, with a report of thunder
and the velocity of lightning; and the darkness of the night
was dispelled by this deadly illumination. The use of the
Greek, or as it might now be called, Saracen fire, was
continued to the middle of the 14th century, when the scientific
or casual compound of nitre, sulphur, and charcoal, effected
a new revolution in the art of war, and the history of
mankind."</p>

<p>Ramsay, our learned historian, (<cite>Universal History</cite>, vol. ii,
p. 150), gives the same account of the Greek fire. Morse,
in his <cite>Universal Geography</cite>, page 588, observes, that naphtha
forms springs in Persia, and, when scattered on the sea,
it burns, and the flame is often wafted to a great distance.</p>

<p>For remarks respecting the naphtha of Persia, and the
universal fire of the followers of Zoroaster, see the article
on <a href="#NAPx"><i>Naphtha</i>.</a> In naphtha districts, the quantity of inflammable
air is so great, that it is used for fuel.</p>

<p>Since writing the above, we have examined Ruggeri, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pyrotechnie
Militaire</cite>, p. 289), and find nothing new. He states
the composition of Greek fire, on the authority of others, to
consist of naphtha, sulphur, bitumen, camphor, and petroleum;
that it was invented by Callinicus, and employed against the Saracens
as an incendiary; that Pliny, in his time, mentioned a
combustible substance, which was thrown upon armed men,
and burnt and destroyed them in the midst of the battle;
that it was employed successfully by the successors of Constantine,
and its composition was kept a state secret; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
the Turks used it, or a composition of a similar nature, at
the siege of Damieta, in 1249, forty-five years after the
death of Roger Bacon; and, finally, that, when the composition
and effects of gunpowder became known, the Greek fire,
although it laid the foundation of the invention of gunpowder,
was no longer in use, and the secret of the original preparation
became lost. See <a href="#GUNx"><i>Gunpowder</i>.</a></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXXI. Of Mines and Mining.</i></p>

<p>A mine is a subterraneous passage, dug under the wall or
rampart of a fortification, for the purpose of blowing it up
by gunpowder; and mining is the art of accomplishing this
effect.</p>

<p>The art of mining, having become one of the most essential
parts of the attack and defence of places, should be well
understood; and requires a perfect knowledge of heights,
depths, breadths, and thicknesses; to judge perfectly of
slopes and perpendiculars, whether they be such as are parallel
to the horizon, or such as are visual; together with the
true levels of all kinds of earth. To this may be added, a
knowledge of rocks, clays, soil, &amp;c. and the effect of gunpowder.</p>

<p>Mines were made long before the invention of gunpowder.
The ancients made galleries, or underground passages,
much in the same manner as the moderns, from without,
under the walls of places, which they cut off from the foundation,
and supported with strong props. The intervals
were filled with all manner of combustibles, which, being set
on fire, burnt their props, and the wall, being no longer supported,
fell, by which a breach was made.</p>

<p>The besieged also made underground passages, from the
town, under the besiegers' machines, by which they battered
the walls, to destroy them, proving that necessity has been
the inventress of mines.</p>

<p>The first mines we read of, since the invention of gunpowder,
were made in 1487, by the Genoese, at the attack of
Serezanella, a town in Florence. These, however, failed,
and they were neglected, till Peter Navarro, being then engineer
to the Genoese, and afterwards to the Spaniards, in
1503, against the French, at the siege of the castle del Ovo,
at Naples, made a mine under the wall, and blew it up; in
consequence of which the castle was taken by storm. Valliers
says, that the engineer was Francis George, an Italian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span></p>

<p>The place where the powder is lodged, is called the
chamber of the mine, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourneau</i>, and the passage leading
to the powder, is called the gallery. The line of the least
resistance, is the line drawn from the centre of the chamber,
perpendicular to the surface of the ground; and the excavation,
called the crater, is the pit or hole, made by springing
the mine.</p>

<p>Counter-mines are those made by the besieged, whereas
mines are generally made by the besiegers. Both mines and
counter-mines, are made in the same manner, and for like
purposes, viz. to blow up their enemies and their works.</p>

<p>Galleries, made within the fortification, before the place
is attacked, and from which several branches are carried to
different places, are generally 4 and 4<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> feet wide, and 5 or
5<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> feet high. The earth is supported from falling in, by
arches and walls, as they are to remain for a considerable
time. But when mines are made to be used in a short
time, then the galleries are but 3 or 3<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> feet wide, and 5 feet
high, and the earth is supported by wooden frames, or
props.</p>

<p>The gallery being carried on to the place, where the powder
is to be lodged, the miners make the chambers. This is
generally of a cubical form, large enough to hold the wooden
box, which contains the powder necessary for the charge.
The box is lined with straw and sand bags, to prevent the
powder from contracting dampness.</p>

<p>The chamber is sunk rather lower than the gallery, if the
soil permits; but where water is to be apprehended, it must
be made higher than the gallery; otherwise the besieged will
let in the water, and spoil the mine.</p>

<p>The fire is communicated to the mine by a pipe, or hose,
made of coarse cloth, whose diameter is about 1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches, called
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">saucisson</i>, (for the filling of which, near half a pound of powder
is allowed to every foot), extending from the chamber
to the entrance of the gallery, to the end of which is
fixed a match, that the miner who sets fire to it, may have
time to retire before it reaches the chamber.</p>

<p>To prevent the powder from contracting any dampness,
the saucisson is laid in a small trough, called an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">auget</i>, made
of boards 3<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches broad, joined together lengthwise, with
straw in it, and round the saucisson, with a wooden cover
nailed upon it.</p>

<p>The quantity of powder, required to charge mines, depends
upon the nature of the soil. That which is more tenacious,
will require the greatest force to separate its parts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
The density may be learned, comparatively speaking, by determining
the specific gravity of each kind of soil. The requisites
in mining may be ascertained by four simple problems,
which relate to the nature of the soil, the diameter of
the excavation, the line of least resistance, and the charge.</p>

<p class="p1">The gallery and chamber being ready to be loaded, a
strong box of wood is made of the size and figure of the
chamber, being about one-third or one-fourth larger than is
required for containing the necessary quantity of powder.
Against the sides and bottom of the box is put some straw,
and this straw is covered over with empty sand bags, to prevent
the powder from contracting any dampness. A hole is
made in the side, next the gallery, near the bottom, for the
saucisson to pass through, which is fixed to the middle of the
bottom, by means of a wooden peg, to prevent its loosening
from the powder, or to hinder the enemy (if he should reach
the entrance) from being able to tear it out. This done, the
powder is brought in sand bags, and thrown loosely in the
box, and covered also with straw and sand bags. Upon this is
put the cover of the box, pressed down very tight with strong
props; and, to render them more secure, planks are also put
above them, against the earth, and wedged in as fast as possible.</p>

<p>This done, the vacant spaces between the props are filled
up with stones and dung, and rammed in the strongest manner.
The least neglect in this work will considerably alter
the effect of the mine. Then the auget, or small trough, is
laid from the chamber to the entrance of the gallery, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
some straw at the bottom; and the saucisson laid in it, with
straw over it. Lastly, it must be shut with a wooden cover,
nailed upon it. Great care must be taken in stopping up the
gallery, not to press too hard upon the auget, for fear of spoiling
the saucisson, which may hinder the powder from taking
fire, and prevent the mine from springing. The gallery is
stopped up with stones, earth and dung, well rammed, six or
seven feet further from the chamber than the length of the
line of the least resistance.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Before closing this article, short as it is, compared with a
full view of the subject, which belongs exclusively to engineering,
we shall notice, from Belidor, the <i>globe of compression</i>
in mines. If we imagine a large globe of earth, homogeneous
in all its parts, and a certain quantity of powder
lodged in its centre, so as to produce a proper effect without
bursting the globe; by setting fire to the powder, it is evident
that the explosion will act all round, to overcome the obstacles
which oppose its motion; and as the particles of the earth
are porous, they will compress each other in proportion as
the flame increases, and the capacity of the chamber increases
likewise: but the particles of the earth next to the chamber
will communicate a part of their motion to those next to
them, and those to their neighbours; and this communication
will thus continue in a decreasing proportion, till the whole
force of explosion is entirely spent; and the particles of earth
beyond this term will remain in the same state as they were
at first. The particles of earth, that have been acted upon by
the force of explosion, will compose a globe, which Mr. Belidor
calls the globe of <i>compression</i>. He observed, that, when
a mine exploded, and threw up the ground over it, its action
was, at the same time, felt in a circular direction, throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
the surrounding ground, to a distance at least equal to the
oblique line drawn from the centre of inflammation to the
edge of the funnel.</p>

<p>Mines and counter-mines are now called offensive and defensive
mines. The hole made by the explosion is called
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entonnoir</i>, crater, or funnel.</p>

<p>In the system of counter-mines, we have the <i>magistral
gallery</i>, or gallery of the counterscarp, which is that extended
below the covered way, from which branches are pushed
to overthrow the works and batteries of the beseiger, that
crown it; the <i>enveloping gallery</i> that communicates with the
other passages, called the <i>galleries of communication</i>, and is
nearly parallel with the first at the distance of from forty to
sixty yards. Other galleries are pushed forward, leaving the
enveloping gallery, projecting at least thirty yards, and having
spaces between them of about fifty yards in width; so
that the enemy's miner, whose work may be heard under
ground about thirty yards, may not pass between any two of
them without being discovered. These are called <i>listening
galleries</i>. It may be observed, that, from these galleries,
branches are carried forward to establish chambers under the
works of the enemy. Those who wish to acquire information
on this, and other subjects, connected with attack and
defence, and on some branches of engineering, would do
well to consult the French work of <i>Bousmard</i>.</p>

<p>There are likewise small mines called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fougasses</i>, used in
the defence of field works. They are seldom more than ten
feet beneath the surface, and are placed at the expected
points of attack, usually nine feet from the salient angles,
and without the counterscarp. The chest of powder and
the saucisson are placed as usual. Barrels or casks and even
grenades are used.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXXII. Of the Means of Increasing the Strength of
Gunpowder for Mining.</i></p>

<p>We mentioned, in the article on gunpowder, that quicklime
had the effect of increasing its strength. It has been
suggested, to employ quicklime, for this purpose, when gunpowder
is used in mining.</p>

<p>Bottée and Riffault (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de l'art de Fabriquer la Poudre
à canon, p. 301</cite>) have given the result of some experiments
on this subject, which we purpose to notice. These
experiments, however, are not satisfactory on this head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Baine, a physician of Foxano, in Tuscany, was the
first who announced the fact, that quicklime would increase
the explosive effect of gunpowder. The increase he states
to be one-third. The proportions are, twenty-three grammes
of quicklime, and one <i>kilogramme</i> of powder.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The
quicklime is powdered, and mixed with the gunpowder.</p>

<p>Various experiments were made, with the eprouvette of
Regnier, which did not establish the truth of Dr. Baine's assertion.
The Tuscan hunters use gunpowder mixed with
lime.</p>

<p>The experiments were made by M. L. Maitre and colonel
Charbonel. They employed pure dry powder, dry powder
mixed with quicklime, moist powder pure, and moist
powder mixed with lime. The object of these experiments
was to ascertain, if the presence of quicklime added to the
force of powder; either as a fourth component part and acting
chemically, or by absorbing the moisture which the powder
contains.</p>

<p>The charge of each was three ounces.</p>

<p>The result of the experiments is thus given:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%" summary="">

<p class="p1">It has been asserted, that the force of gunpowder is increased
by water, alcohol, and ether, in consequence of the
great expansibility of these fluids; but, according to the experiments
of Bottée and Riffault, the range of the ball was
much less when the three fluids were used successively,
than when the dry and pure gunpowder alone was employed.
We are informed by a gentleman, who saw the experiment
made, that when gunpowder is mixed with an equal weight
of fine saw dust, and fired, it will give the same range to a
ball as the same weight of unmixed powder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span></p>

<p>We find that col. Gibbs, (<cite>American Journal of Science</cite>, i.
87), in a letter to professor Silliman, mentions the use of
lime in increasing the strength of gunpowder. He gives a
certificate of the person, whom he employed in blowing
rocks, in which he used quicklime along with powder, in the
proportion of one part of the former to two of the latter. In
the certificate, it is stated, that a charge of this mixture was
found to be equally powerful, or to "answer equally well
with a like quantity of gunpowder," having made upwards of
fifty blasts in this manner, and, as he states, several hundred
in the usual way. He remarks, however, that, when the powdered
lime was mixed with the gunpowder the day before, the
effect was diminished. The colonel attributes the effect to the
desiccation of the powder by the lime; and, as gunpowder
absorbs more or less water, the lime, in its caustic state, takes
it from the powder. If the lime should remain too long, he is
of opinion that it would probably attack the water of crystallization
of the saltpetre, and, according to count Rumford's
idea, destroy a great part of the powder. "The examination
of this subject," says Gibbs, "led me to consider the
increase of the power of gunpowder in various situations,
and of its use in the field. It is well known, that, after a few
discharges, a cannon becomes heated, and the range is much
greater, as well as the recoil. The charge of powder is,
therefore, reduced about one-quarter, to produce the original
effect. As I have not heard or seen any explanation of
this fact, I shall take this opportunity of mentioning, that it
appears to arise from the same cause as the first explained,
<i>viz</i>: the desiccation of the powder, &amp;c."</p>

<p>M. Humboldt, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bulletin de la Société Philomatique</cite>, floreal,
an. 3) it appears, suggested an improvement in mining, not by
increasing the force of gunpowder, but in the charging of it;
to leave a space occupied only by air, a fact well known to
those who are accustomed to this work, although not always
adopted. He states the effect of powder on a shell; that, if
it be filled, it breaks only into two or three pieces; but if only
half filled, it is shattered into a great number, which he attributes
to the presence of air in the shell.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXXIII. Of Incendiary Bombs.</i></p>

<p>These are used in sieges, and on water. Ruggeri gives
the preparation of these bombs as follows, observing to melt
the substances in the order they are mentioned.</p>

<p class="noindent pad3">
1. &nbsp; Three parts of sulphur;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
2. &nbsp; One part of pitch;<br />
3. &nbsp; Two parts of nitrate of potassa;<br />
4. &nbsp; One part of mutton suet.<br />
</p>

<p>After melting these substances, and mixing them intimately,
the mixture is removed from the fire, and two pounds of
gunpowder are added, and thoroughly blended. It is again
submitted to heat, and a sufficient quantity of quick match,
to cover a good sized marron, is immersed. The marron
is furnished with a fuse. The composition hardens on the
match. The match is employed as before described. Water
does not extinguish the fire, produced by the combustion of
this composition. See <a href="#CARx"><i>Carcasses</i> and <i>Fire-Balls</i>.</a></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXXIV. Of Murdering Marrons.</i></p>

<p>Marrons, which take this name, are those, whose effect is
different from the incendiary bomb. The latter is calculated
to set fire to houses, &amp;c. while the former is designed to destroy
the lives of persons.</p>

<p>To make a murdering marron, we prepare, in the usual
manner, a cylindrical case, and fill it with gunpowder, and
then wrap round it, a quantity of pack-thread. In winding
on the thread, care must be taken to cross it in the manner
mentioned in a former article. It is then finished by coating
it with a mixture of glue and wax, or, in preference, pitch.
This prevents the thread from unwrapping, and renders the
case firm and less liable to break. A hole is then made in
its side to the powder, in which we insert a piece of quick-match,
to communicate fire to the contents of the case. A
small fuse, similar to that of a bomb fuse, but shorter, and
made of pasteboard, is also used; and, after it is fixed to the
marron, musket balls, previously pierced with holes, are
nailed round the marron, the nails passing through the balls
into the case. After thus fixing as many balls as the surface
of the case will admit, we cover them with a composition
made of three parts of glue and one part of wax. When this
coating is dry, a hemispherical case is adapted. This case
is a small <i>sack</i> of paper, made round, and filled with gunpowder.
It is placed at the bottom of the marron, and secured
there with paper and glue. The match is conveyed to
the orifice of the fuse of the marron; and, in short, a communication
is so made from the one to the other, that, at a given
time, the fire passes by means of the fuse to the marron,
which then explodes, and throws the balls, with which it is
furnished, in every direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span></p>

<p>Shells, made by uniting two hemispheres, containing powder,
and furnished with balls and a fuse, are also a destructive
weapon of the same character.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXXV. Of Incendiary Rope.</i></p>

<p>We have mentioned, under the head of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tourteaux</i>, or
tarred links and fascines, the compositions made use of for
these preparations. The composition for incendiary rope is
as follows:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">

</table>

<p class="p1">The rosin, sulphur, camphor, and saltpetre are melted,
and mixed thoroughly together, and the kettle, which contains
them, is removed from the fire; the gunpowder is then
added, and intimately blended.</p>

<p>The mixture is again heated, and the rope is then immersed
in it, and suffered to remain until it has imbibed sufficiently.
It is then taken out, and allowed to cool.</p>

<p>After this operation, we melt, in a separate kettle, the following
substances:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl wd60">Rosin</td><td class="tdr wd10">4</td><td class="tdc wd10">&nbsp;parts.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl">Mutton suet</td><td class="tdr">2</td><td class="tdc">&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="p1">When they are melted, and mixed, the rope previously
prepared as above, is thrown into the mixture, and then removed
and hung up.</p>

<p>After this second process, we make, in an earthen vessel,
a priming mixture, in which the rope is sometimes immersed,
or such parts of it, as are to take fire promptly. This priming
paste is composed of,</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Incendiary rope is used more generally in the form of a
ball, which is enclosed in a sack, and fired out of a common
mortar. It was invented by an officer at Toulon. See <a href="#CARx"><i>Carcasses</i>.</a></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXXVI. Of Balloons of Grenades, of Bombs, and of
Flints or Stone.</i></p>

<p>Balloons of this kind are cases, or sacks, made sufficiently
large, containing powder, and enclosing grenades, shells, and
stones.</p>

<p>The balloon of grenades holds twelve charged grenades,
containing different quantities of powder. They are finished
like powder sacks, and <i>corded</i> with small cord, twine, or
thread. The balloon of flints, river stones, or small pebbles,
is made by enclosing these substances along with powder in
a sack, as before stated. These balloons are employed for
the defence of works, &amp;c. See <a href="#POWx"><i>Powder Sacks</i>.</a></p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ballon à Bombes</i>, of the French, is the same. It
is a bag, in which are placed <i>beds</i> of smaller bombs, that are
charged and interlaid with gunpowder. The bag is put into
another covering, that is pitched, with the neck closely tied
up with pack thread, in which a fuse is fixed, as in ordinary
bombs. The English say, that Colonel Shrapnel's invention
of the spherical case shot, is of a superior kind. We purpose,
therefore, to notice them in the following section.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="SHRx" id="SHRx"></a><i>Sec. XXXVII. Of Spherical Case-Shot.</i></p>

<p>Ordinary case shot is a tin case or cannister, filled with
iron balls, so as to make up the weight of the shot. The balls
are seldom less than 1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> oz, in weight. Little effect is to be
expected from firing case shot beyond 300 yards, from the
very great divergency of the balls. The following summary
of the effects and advantages of this species of shot, which,
as invented by Col. Shrapnel, is called the Shrapnel shell,
will be sufficient for our purpose. It is extracted from a
book lately published.</p>

<p>1st. The whole charge takes effect on the enemy at any
distance. By the present mode of firing, the greatest part
of the charge disperses as soon as it leaves the muzzle of
the gun, and cannot be directed.</p>

<p>2nd. Grape, or case shot, may be fired with effect equally
close and collected, to any distance within the range of the
piece; and the artillery need not advance within musket shot
of the enemy, to make use of this kind of fire with its full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
effect, and are not so subject to have their guns charged either
by cavalry or infantry.</p>

<p>3d. It requires less precision and exactness, to point a
piece of ordnance charged with spherical case shot than with
round shot; because case shot is a wide and dispersed fire,
and the difficulty in elevation consequently less.</p>

<p>4th. Its comparative destruction with that of round shot
will be, generally, as the number of the shot within the shells
to one; that is to say, a three pounder, twenty-two to one
in its favour; a six pounder, fifty to one, &amp;c.; in which calculation
is not enumerated any effect from the splinters of
the shell.</p>

<p>5th. Small balls cannot be projected to very considerable
distances, unless enclosed in heavy spherical cases, which,
from their form and weight, are not much influenced by the
resistance of the air, or diverted from their direction.</p>

<p>6th. The explosion of the shell makes no change in the
direction of the shot within; they consequently complete the
shell's track, or curve, which has sometimes been observed to
be 400 yards.</p>

<p>7th. From the unevenness of the ground, such as hillocks,
banks, fallow fields, &amp;c. all shot which graze, most commonly
lodge: whereas, by using this shell, the whole charge will be
carried over these irregularities, and reach the object with
its full contents of balls.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXXVIII. Of the Fire-Rain, according to Casimir
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Siemienowick'">Siemienowicz</ins>.</i></p>

<p>The composition, which produces fire-rain, which we purpose
to notice in this place, is taken from the "<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Artis Magnæ
Artilleriæ</cite>" of Casimir <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Siemienowick'">Siemienowicz</ins>. He seems, however,
to have taken it from a German author.</p>

<p>The fire rain is an incendiary fire-work, and calculated, like
other incendiaries, for firing the houses of a besieged place
or city, which are covered with shingles, laths, stubble, or
reeds. Besides several other compositions, designated by
artificers, that of fire-rain was so called from its supposed
resemblance to a shower of rain.</p>

<p>To prepare this composition, the following method is used:
We take 24 parts of sulphur, and melt in a copper, or iron pot,
over live coals without flame, and then throw in 16 parts of
saltpetre, and mix it with an iron spatula, to incorporate the
whole. The pot is now removed from the fire, and when
the composition is become rather cold, stir into it 8 parts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
grained powder. The composition is then poured on a
marble slab, or metallic plate, where it is allowed to cool. It
is then broken into pieces of the size of a walnut, which,
when used, is interspersed with quick match, covered with
gunpowder, and put into shells or bombs.</p>

<p>These bombs are made in the same manner, as those,
which are formed in fire-works for exhibition.</p>

<p>Wood, covered with this composition, will burn in the
same manner as the shells. The globe of fire is also similar
to those for exhibition. The mortar is elevated at an angle
of 45°, in order that the globe may go to the greatest height,
and the greatest range; for the fall of the inflamed matter,
which is dispersed in all directions by the powder, is more
or less vertical, and, in that state, lights upon houses, &amp;c.
This effect, that of setting fire to one or more houses, depends
greatly on the accuracy of their discharge from the mortar.</p>

<p>The following compositions are also used for the same
purpose, observing to follow the same manner of mixing the
ingredients:</p>

<p class="p1">These compositions may be used in the manner already
described. Two wooden hemispheres, filled with the preparation
and joined together, is the usual mode of forming a fire
bomb. The bomb or globe is then covered with strong canvass,
and finished by dipping it, or smearing it with melted
pitch. Over this, two or three covers of canvass are sometimes
sewed. When the bomb is dry, we put it in a case, in the
same manner as directed for the murdering, and incen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>diary
bombs. The case is charged with fine meal-powder,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The modern improvements, which are many, supersede
the rain-fire. Fire stone, for instance, is a more powerful
preparation. The incendiaries made with this composition,
and the ordinary carcass, are more effectual for this purpose.
That the Greek fire was an active composition, and produced
very destructive effects on towns and shipping, there
can be no doubt; notwithstanding the invention of gunpowder
has completely changed the art of war, and superseded, as we
have shown in our articles on <i>gunpowder</i> and <i>Greek fire</i>, the
use of the incendiary composition of the Greeks.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XXXIX. Of the Effect of Mirrors in inflaming Bodies
at a Distance.</i></p>

<p>As this subject may be of some interest to the reader, at
least in relation to an important fact, that of the <i>concentration</i>
of the calorific rays of the sun, which has had the effect
of burning bodies at some distance, we deem the following
facts not irrelevant.</p>

<p>The effects of burning glasses, both by refraction and reflection,
are noticed by Empedocles and Euclid, who composed
a treatise on the ancient optics and catoptrics. It has
been thought, that the Romans had a method of lighting
their sacred fire by some such means. Aristophanes, in one
of his comedies, introduces a person as making use of a
globe, filled with water, to cancel a bond that was against
him, by thus melting the wax of the seal. Plutarch, in
his life of Numa, says, that the instruments used to kindle
fires, were metallic dishes, which were placed opposite to
the sun, and the combustible matter in the centre, by which,
it is probable, he meant the focus, conceiving that to be at
the centre of the mirror's concavity.</p>

<p>Father Kircher was the first, who thought of substituting,
for a concave mirror, several plane mirrors, so disposed, that
the sun's rays reflected at their surface might converge towards
the same point. He employed five only of these mirrors,
which he so arranged, that the concurrence of the rays
should take place at a distance of more than one hundred
feet, and he found the heat there to be scarcely supportable.
"Now," says Kircher, "if five mirrors produce so considerable
an effect, what would a hundred or a thousand do,
arranged in the same manner? They would excite so violent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
a heat, that it would set fire to every thing, and reduce all
to ashes."</p>

<p>Orpheus compares his <i>jaspis</i> to rock crystal, and says that
it kindles fire, and that he knew how to use rock crystal as a
burning glass. Diodorus calls some kinds of jasper transparent,
and sky-coloured. The jaspis, described in the Revelation
of St. John (<cite>chapter</cite> xxi, verse 11, 18, 19,) may have
been the same stone.</p>

<p>It is not our intention, however, to notice the history of
mirrors, from the time of Moses, (<cite>Exodus</cite>, chap. xxxviii,
verse 8,) or of Job, (<cite>Job</cite>, chap. xxxvii, verse 18) through
different periods of time, to the present day; as the reader
may find an interesting account on this head in Beckman,
(<cite>History of Inventions</cite>, vol. iii, p. 154); but to state in particular
the celebrated experiment of Archimedes, which has
indeed astonished men of science, who have lived since that
period. There can be no doubt of the fact, if we reflect for a
moment, that some modern experiments have justified the
conclusion which has been drawn; and, therefore, that the
solar rays may be concentrated to such a degree, as to inflame
bodies at some distance off: and as the heat produced
is much greater than that of our hottest furnaces, incredible
as it may appear, there can be no question as to the effect,
which may be produced by a system of mirrors.</p>

<p>By means of burning mirrors, Archimedes burnt the Roman
ships, which were beseiging Syracuse, and reduced
them to ashes.</p>

<p>Descartes, among others, discredited the story as fallacious;
but Kircher made many experiments, with a view of
establishing its credibility. He tried the effect of a number
of plane mirrors, and with five mirrors of the same size,
placed in a frame, he contrived to throw the rays reflected
from them to the same spot, at the distance of more
than one hundred feet; and, by this means, he produced such
a degree of heat, as led him to conclude, that, by increasing
their number, he could have set fire to inflammable substances
at a greater distance. He likewise made a voyage to
Syracuse, in company with his pupil, Schottus, in order
to examine the place of the supposed transaction; and they
were both of opinion, that the galleys of Marcellus could not
have been more than thirty paces from Archimedes.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span></p>

<p>Proclus is also said to have destroyed the navy of Vitalian,
beseiging Byzantium, near Constantinople, by means of
burning glasses.</p>

<p>Among the moderns, the most remarkable burning mirrors
have been those of Magine; of Septala of Milan, which
was nearly three and a half feet in diameter, and which
burnt at the distance of fifteen or sixteen paces; of Vilette,
and Tschirinhausen; the new complex one of M. Buffon;
that of Trudaine, and that of Parker. Tschirinhausen's burning
glass was between three and four feet in diameter, and
its focus was rendered more powerful by a second one.</p>

<p>It may not be improper to notice the construction, as well
as the effect of some of these mirrors. La Brocquire, a traveller
of the 15th century, says, that, at Damascus, they
made mirrors of steel that magnify objects, and one of them,
when exposed to the sun, reflected the heat so strongly, as to
set fire to a plank fifteen or sixteen feet distant.</p>

<p>M. Buffon constructed a machine consisting of a number
of mirrors, by which he seems to have revived the secret
of Archimedes, and to have vindicated the credit of history
in this point. The experiment was first tried with twenty-four
mirrors, which readily set on fire a combustible matter
prepared of pitch and tow, laid on a deal board at a distance
of sixty-six French feet. He then pursued the attempt, and
put together a kind of polyhedron, consisting of one hundred
and sixty-eight pieces of plane looking glass, each six
inches square; and by means of this, some boards of beech
wood were set on fire at a distance of one hundred and fifty
feet, and a silver plate was melted at the distance of sixty
feet. This machine, in the next stage of its improvement,
contained 360 plane mirrors, each 8 inches long, and 6 broad,
mounted on a frame 8 feet high, and 7 feet broad. With
12 of these mirrors, light combustible matters were kindled
at a distance of 20 feet; with 45 of them, at the same distance,
a large tin vessel was melted; and with 117, a thin
piece of silver. When the whole machine was employed, all
the metals were melted at the distance of twenty-five, and
even of forty feet. Wood was kindled in a clear sky, at the
distance of 210 feet. Mr. Buffon afterwards constructed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
machine, which contained four hundred mirrors, each six
inches square, with which he could melt lead and tin at the
distance of 140 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. Parker, an eminent glass manufacturer, in Fleet street,
London, constructed the most powerful burning mirror ever
made. He erected an out building at the bottom of his garden
for the purpose of carrying on his operations. He succeeded
in forming a most powerful burning lens. Its diameter
was three feet. Platinum, iron, steel, flint, &amp;c. were melted in a
few seconds, on being exposed to its immense focus. A diamond
weighing thirty grains was reduced to six grains, in
the space of thirty minutes. It opened and foliated like the
leaves of a flower, and emitted whitish fumes, (carbonic acid
gas;) when close again, it bore a polish, and retained its form.
Garnets, clay, &amp;c. soon melted.</p>

<p>Seven hundred guineas were subscribed to indemnify the
inventor, it having cost him seven hundred pounds. It was
purchased, however, and presented by lord Macartney to
the Chinese government, and remains now at Pekin.</p>

<p>M. Payard, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives des Découvertes</cite>, &amp;c.) has invented
a burning mirror, consisting of several plane mirrors so arranged
as to concentrate the solar heat into a focus with
great precision. The arrangement, it may be proper to state,
is different from that heretofore used, and the effect is said
to be very powerful.</p>

<p>A polygonal mirror, from a suggestion of the celebrated
Buffon, was erected in the Botanic Garden at Paris, in 1747,
and had also a very powerful effect. This mirror was composed
of one hundred and sixty-eight plates of tinned or silvered
glass, capable of moving in every direction and of being
fixed at different degrees of inclination, so that there
could be given to the whole, a form more or less concave,
and the focus be thrown to different distances. This mirror
set fire to wood at two hundred feet, and fused metals at
forty-five feet.</p>

<p>As caloric, like light, follows the same laws with respect
to its motion, and as the angle of incidence is equal to the
angle of reflection, the radiation of heat, conducted after the
manner of Pictet's experiment, has not only occasioned the
combustion of gunpowder, but of other inflammable substances.
But, for this purpose, the mirrors must be large and
extremely bright. That heat radiates in all directions, and
is reflected, and that the calorific rays may thereby be concentrated,
are facts which are now universally admitted. The
application of this principle, by using concave mirrors suffi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>ciently
large, has, we are informed, produced the explosion
of gunpowder. They were placed about twelve feet apart.
In the focus of one a live coal was put, which was constantly
blown with a double bellows, and in the focus of the other
some gunpowder. In all our experiments with the ordinary
reflectors, we could never produce any thing like the heat
necessary to inflame gunpowder. That the principle is substantiated
by experiment is evident; for the rays of a heated
body, or a substance which produces heat, as a lamp or candle,
placed in the focus of a concave mirror, are reflected in
parallel lines, and if another concave mirror be placed opposite
to it at some distance, the calorific rays will be thus intercepted
and reflected back in a focus. This <i>focus</i>, therefore,
like the focus of a burning glass, is the concentration of
all the parallel rays of heat.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="POIx" id="POIx"></a><i>Sec. XL. Of Incendiary and Poisoned Arrows.</i></p>

<p>The bow is a very ancient weapon of offence, made of
steel, wood, horn, or other elastic substance, which, after
being bent by means of a string fastened to its two
ends, in returning to its natural state, throws out an arrow
with great force.  That the bow was a weapon of
offence among the nations of antiquity, the inhabitants
of Asia and Africa, and the Aborigines of this country,
and that it was used in Europe, before the invention or use
of fire-arms, are facts, of which we have abundant proof.
Bows are much the same in all countries.  It has generally
two inflections or bendings, between which, in the place
where the arrow is drawn, is a right line. The Grecian bow
was adorned with gold or silver. The Scythian bow was
distinguished from those of the Grecians and other nations,
by its incurvation, which was so great, as to form a half
moon, or semi-circle. The Persian bows were made of reed.
The Indians used the same material, as well for their bows
as their arrows. The Lycian bows were made of the cornel
tree; and those of the Ethiopians, which surpassed all others
in magnitude, were made of the palm tree. The Romans,
although they did not admit bows in the infancy of their republic;
yet they considered them as hostile weapons. They
employed auxiliary archers in all their wars. The Amazonians,
as well as the primitive Grecians, in drawing their
bow, did not pull back their hand towards their right ear,
according to the fashion of the ancient Persians, and of modern
ages; but, placing their bow directly before them, returned
their hand upon their right breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span></p>

<p>While noticing this subject, we may also observe, that
Louis XI first abolished the use of bows in France, introducing,
in their place, the halberd, pike, and broadsword.
The long bow was much in use by the English archers, and
many laws were passed encouraging its use. In the time of
Henry VIII, the parliament complained of the disuse of
long bows.</p>

<p>The bow is now laid aside altogether as a war weapon.
The arrows, made use of, were armed with barbed iron, and,
among the aborigines of this and other countries, with a
stone, formed in a particular manner, many of which are
picked up in this country. We have found them at West
Point. The natives were in the habit of poisoning their arrows,
by using a particular composition, not known; the effect
of which, however, when the arrow penetrated into the
flesh, is always destructive.</p>

<p>Roggewein, (<cite>Voyage for the Discovery of Southern Lands</cite>)
speaking of Batavia, observes, that, at this place, there are
some of the Macassars, so famous for their little poisoned
arrows, which they blow through a trunk. This poison is the
juice of a tree, that grows in Macassar, and in the Bougie
islands. They dip the points of their arrows in this juice,
and then let them dry. The wound they give is mortal.</p>

<p>The natives of Ceylon are very dexterous with the bow
and arrow; so also are the Hottentots, according to Kolben,
in his <cite>Voyage to the Cape of Good Hope</cite>. A Hottentot arrow
consists of a small tapering stick or cane, of about a foot
and a half in length, pointed with a small thin piece of iron
bearded, and joined to the stick or cane by a barrel. Their
bows are made of olive, or iron wood, and the strings, of
the sinews and entrails of beasts. When they attack a lion,
tiger, or leopard, which they do with wonderful resolution
and dexterity, they employ slings (<i>hassagayes</i>) and arrows,
which for that purpose are usually poisoned.</p>

<p>Ellis (<cite>Voyage for the Discovery of a North-West Passage</cite>)
speaks of the bows and arrows of the Eskimaux Indians, and
the facility with which they use them, but not of poisoned
arrows. Moore, (<cite>Travels into the interior of Africa</cite>) observes,
that a native took him to his house, and showed him
a great number of arrows, daubed over with a black mixture,
said to be so venomous, that, if the arrow did but draw
blood, it would be mortal, unless the person who made the
mixture had a mind to cure it. For the man observed to
him, that there were no poisonous herbs, whose effects might
not be prevented by the application of other herbs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span></p>

<p>Poisoned arrows, according to various historians, were
used in the remotest periods of antiquity. The mode of
treating wounds in the twelfth century, by using membrane
like the present gold-beaters' skin, may be mentioned in relation
to this circumstance. The Emperor, John Commenus,
accidentally wounded himself in the hand with a poisoned
arrow, while hunting, and applied a piece of skin to the
wound. The emperor, however, died in consequence of the
wound, after it had become inflamed under the pellicle;
which, in large wounds, and when the skin is suffered to remain
too long, is commonly the case, though the poison alone
we are informed, would have been a sufficient cause of death.
Other instances are also mentioned of death being occasioned
by the poisoned arrow.</p>

<p>On the subject of poisoned arrows, the following outline
is given on the authority of the author of the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire
de l'Industrie</cite>, vol. 3, p. 50.</p>

<p>The juice of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mancenilier</i>, or the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lianes des Marais</i>,
called in Guyanne <i>Curare</i>, is employed by some savages.
The Arabs use the juice of a milky shrub, which they name
<i>chark</i>, and called by the Persians <i>gulbut samour</i>. Indian
arrows are said to be poisoned with the venom of serpents.
The islanders of Java rub their darts with the blood and venom
of the lizard <i>Gecko</i>, which they kill by whipping it to
death. The needles of the Macassars, they poison with the
juice of a tree, which is said to belong to the <i>ahouai</i> of
America. At Ceylon they extract the venomous matter from
the <i>Nerium</i>, or <i>laurel rose</i>. The ancient Gauls are said by
M. Paw to have poisoned their arms with the juice of the
<i>Caprisiguier</i>. In some cantons of the Pyrenees and Alps,
they express the juice of the roots of the Aconitum, (thora),
which they put on weapons.</p>

<p>M. Charles Coquebert, in a memoir read to the Philomatic
Society, in 1798, observes, that the ancient European inhabitants
employed three plants to poison their arrows;
namely, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veratrum album</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Helleborus viridis</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aconitum
Lysocitonum</i>.</p>

<p>There have been obtained from the Society Islands some
poisoned arrows, and a pot of the composition, in which they
are dipped. It has the appearance of a black fluid extract,
and seems to be an infusion or decoction of some plants,
probably mixed with other substances.</p>

<p>With respect to the poisons obtained from the animal
kingdom, they are principally liquid juices. Fontana, in
particular, has paid attention to this subject. The poison of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
the viper, which is contained in two small vesicles of the
mouth, when the animal bites, is forced, through the fangs,
into the wound. If the vesicles be extracted, or the liquor
prevented from flowing into the wound, the bite is harmless.
Sharp instruments, as arrows, when they penetrate the skin,
being covered with the poison, will have the same effect.
Fontana made a set of experiments on the dry poison of the
viper, and a similar set on gum arabic, and obtained the
same results! Small birds and quadrupeds die immediately,
when they are bitten by a viper; but to a man, the bite is
not always fatal. The experiments and observations of
Francini, (<cite>Abridg. Phil. Trans.</cite> ii, 8,) Mead, (<cite>On Poisons</cite>,
p. 35,) Tyson, (<cite>Phil. Trans.</cite> vol. xii,) Fontana, Redi, Russel,
the late Dr. Ramsay, of Charleston, (<cite>Phil. Mag.</cite> xvii,
125,) and Dr. B. S. Barton, (<cite>Amer. Phil. Trans.</cite> vol. ii, p.
100,) furnish an abundance of facts on the venom of the viper,
and some on the antidotes to the bite. Dr. F. G. Gren,
late professor at Halle, in Saxony, (<cite>Principles of Modern
Chemistry</cite>, ii, p. 47), observes, in speaking of the experiments
of Fontana, as the poison of the viper exhibits all the
characteristic properties of gum, whether the gum be merely
the vehicle of a peculiar venomous substance, which, upon
investigation, escapes the notice of the senses? or whether
this action upon living bodies, so different from its usual nature,
be imparted to the gum, merely by a change in the proportions
of its radicals, so slight as to be unobservable in its
chemical analysis?</p>

<p>Mr. Misson (<cite>Travels through Germany and Italy</cite>) observes,
that, at the arsenal at Venice, he saw some pocket
cross bows, and steel arrows, with which the late lord of
Padua used to kill such as passed by, without their knowing
from whence they received their wounds.</p>

<p>Arrows were sometimes employed by the Grecians, for
conveying their Greek fire. It seems, according to Gibbon,
(<cite>History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</cite>, vol.
vii, 284), that, among the different means of discharging it,
that with the bow and arrow was one. For this purpose,
flax or tow was dipped in the composition, and wrapped
round the arrow, which was discharged the moment it was
inflamed.</p>

<p>The Indians, and Africans in particular, have been very
ingenious in poisoning several kinds of warlike instruments.
The blades of swords, the barbs of arrows, balls, &amp;c. they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
have prepared in such a way, as to be extremely poisonous.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
See <a href="#POIy"><i>Poisoned Ball</i>.</a></p>

<p>With respect to incendiary arrows, it will be sufficient to
remark, that the barb, for this purpose, was furnished with
a composition, which, when inflamed, was projected by the
bow to the spot designed to be set on fire. They were not
much employed, and at the present day, are entirely out of
use. Tow, for instance, previously prepared with pitch,
meal-powder, and turpentine, or a composition equally combustible,
when wrapped round the head of an arrow, and
thrown at the moment of its inflammation, would, in many
cases, set fire to buildings. But, as the present system of
employing incendiary fire-works, presents advantages decidedly
in its favour, it is hardly probable, that the bow and
arrow will ever be employed by civilized nations for that
purpose. The ancient <i>catapulta</i> was particularly calculated
for throwing incendiary compositions.</p>

<p>The catapulta was an engine, contrived for throwing
arrows, darts, and stones, upon the enemy. Their power
was so great, that they would project a stone of a hundred
weight with an almost incredible force. Josephus, in noticing
this machine, says, that the stones thrown out of it,
beat down the battlements, knocked off the angles of the towers,
and had a force sufficient to level a deep file of soldiers.</p>


<p class="centerx"><a name="PYSx" id="PYSx"></a><i>Sec. XLI. Of Pyrotechnical Sponge.</i></p>

<p>This name is applied to the German <i>black match</i>, or tinder,
used chiefly to receive the file from flint and steel. We
have, on a former occasion, noticed the preparation of the
substance called spunk; namely, by immersing the fungus in
a solution of saltpetre, and then drying it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span></p>

<p>There are various species of agaric. The mushroom is a
genus belonging to the order Fungi, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">boletus igniarius</i>,
spunk, or touch-wood, called also female agaric, is employed,
not only as a match, but as a styptic. The fungous
excrescences, which grow upon old oaks, ash trees, firs, &amp;c.
are all used for the same purpose. The Germans take the
soft inner substance in preference to the hard, and after
beating with a hammer to render it still softer, they boil it in
ley, then dry it, and boil it again, in a solution of nitrate of
potassa, and finally dry it in an oven for use.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amadou</i> of the French, is the same as our spunk, or
pyrotechnical sponge. It is always made, like the latter,
from various kinds of agaric, which constitute the spongy
excrescence of trees. The French prepare it for use in the
manner before stated. They prepare <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amadou</i>, also, by soaking
blue paper in a solution of nitre. They sometimes employ
it in the state of tinder, and, for this purpose, burn it to
a coal.</p>

<p>In the East Indies, there is a white spongy plant, which,
when reduced to a kind of charcoal, furnishes a very good
tinder.</p>

<p>Spunk, or pyrotechnical sponge, is generally made in Germany.</p>

<p>In the preparation of ordinary <i>tinder</i>, the best mode of
carbonizing the old linen, instead of burning and then smothering
the flame, is to char the rags in close iron vessels. It
may be made more quick by soaking it in a solution of nitre,
and then drying it.</p>

<p>Dry turf, or peat, is susceptible of inflammation by the
spark, and, if previously soaked in a solution of nitre, the
effect, we are told, is much the same as with spunk. Professor
Beckman (<cite>History of Inventions</cite>, i, p. 333), remarks,
that a spark falling accidentally on a turf moor, during a
dry summer, often sets it on fire; and the conflagration it occasions,
often lasts so long, that it cannot escape notice. Of
the earth taking fire in this manner, there are many instances
to be found in the ancients. One of the most remarkable,
is that mentioned by Tacitus, (<cite>Annal.</cite>, lib. xiii, cap. 57), who
relates, that not long after the building of the city of Cologne,
the neighbouring land took fire, and burned in such a
manner, that the corn, villages, and every production of the
fields, were destroyed by the flames, which advanced even to
the walls of the city. This was certainly a morass set on
fire.</p>

<p>Gmelin (<cite>Travels in Russia</cite>, 1768-69, vol. i, p. 22) speaks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
of a morass in Siberia, where a village was erected, which,
on account of its situation, the inhabitants deserted. This
morass was set on fire, and when he was there, had been
burning for more than six months; and being very inflammable,
produced much devastation.</p>

<p>Turf, which consists of a congeries of vegetable roots or
fibres, partly in a dry and decomposed state, or partly carbonized,
when separated from earthy matter, and treated in
the same manner as the medullary excrescence of wood,
may be advantageously employed in like manner; but it is to
be remarked, that for this purpose, the small and more friable,
and consequently the more decomposed part, should be
preferred. That turf, or peat, has been used for fuel, from
time immemorial, there can be no doubt; since it is furnished
in some countries very abundantly, and its inflammability
has been long known.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XLII. Of Extinguishing Flame with Fired Gunpowder.</i></p>

<p>The different methods for extinguishing fire in chimnies,
by using salt, sulphur, &amp;c. to <i>smother</i> the flame, as it is
called, depend on one principle, that of producing either a
gas or vapour, which supplies the place of atmospheric air,
and as it is a non-supporter of combustion, extinguishes the
flame. Carbonic acid gas would have the same effect as the
sulphurous acid gas, produced by the combustion of sulphur,
or the vapour of salt.</p>

<p>So long, however, as the air is permitted to have a
draught, the fire will continue to burn; and hence, without
making any remarks on the bursting of chimnies, by closing
all the avenues, by which the air enters, as the fire must
exert a lateral pressure, this plan is generally adopted.</p>

<p>It has been suggested, and in fact the suggestion is by no
means new, that the <i>smoke</i> of fired gunpowder would extinguish
flame. Some recommend firing a pistol up a chimney
for this purpose, and others again, throwing gunpowder into
the fire.</p>

<p>In the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire de l'Industrie</cite>, iii, p. 31, I find some
remarks on this subject. Besides the use of gunpowder, the
vapour of water is recommended; but having some objections,
among which, that of accelerating the current of air in
particular, it is laid aside. Intercepting the passage of air
seems to be preferred.</p>

<p>It appears, that the person, who first suggested the use of
gunpowder for this purpose, was a Zachariah Greyl, of
Augsburgh, in 1720.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span></p>

<p>The effect was attributed to the <i>vapour</i> of the gunpowder
destroying the elasticity of the air; and the same effect is
said to take place when the vapour of sulphur, or of volatile
acids, is employed. It is hardly necessary to add, that this
conclusion, of the diminution of the elasticity of the air, on
which depends its fitness for combustion, (according to the
theory then advanced), is altogether hypothetical; and the
cause of the extinction of the flame, must be sought for in
the substances themselves, producing an atmosphere, which
is decidedly a non-supporter of combustion.</p>

<p>The <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de Paris for</cite> 1785, and the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Affiches de Province</cite>
of the same year, recommend the use of brimstone. In
the same work, page 454, it is said, that marine salt is employed
with success for the extinguishing of fires; and that,
when a certain quantity is thrown upon the fire, it evaporates
in an instant, and displaces, by its <i>fumes</i>, the atmospheric
air. In 1723, M. Hoffer invented his machine; and
in 1781, M. Cadet de Vaux made some experiments before
Leroy, Lavoisier, and Macquer, on the means of rendering
bodies incombustible by saline substances, and different
modes of extinguishing flame.</p>

<p>In 1722, the Germans announced, that, by means of a certain
quantity of gunpowder, flame at all times might be extinguished.
The secret, for such it was then considered, has
been revived; for the same plan has lately been recommended
by a modern writer. M. de Reaumur communicated to the
French academy, an account of this contrivance, by which it
appears, that the machine was a large box, or cask, that contained
a large quantity of water; in the centre of which, was
placed a case of sheet tin, containing some pounds of cannon
powder. To this was attached a fuse. When it was
inflamed, the gunpowder would burst the vessel, and disperse
the water in every direction. See the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal des Savants</cite>,
1725, p. 671.</p>

<p>In the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire de l'Industrie</cite>, a prompt and certain
method is recommended for cleaning the tunnel of chimnies.
This is rather a novel plan. Of its efficacy we know nothing.
It consists in taking a powder, composed of three
parts of saltpetre, two parts of salt of tartar, and one part of
flowers of sulphur, (or fulminating powder), and exploding
it on a shovel up the chimney. The explosion indeed may
detach the loose pieces of soot; but it cannot remove the
harder crust, and besides, it would endanger the chimney
taking fire.</p>

<p>We know that various contrivances have been used for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
same purpose; and of the chimney cleansing machines, calculated
to diminish the number of infant victims of a filthy
and disgusting operation, that of Mr. Smart appears to possess
every advantage, which (or a plan similar to it) is now
in use in our cities. A description of this machine, and
another by Hornblower, are given in Gregory's <cite>Mechanics</cite>,
vol. ii, p. 138. The invention of Mr. Hornblower consists
of a vessel, into which air is condensed, that communicates
with a tube, charged with small gravel, which being blown
up the chimney, brings down the soot.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XLIII. Of the Inflammable Dart.</i></p>

<p>This dart is made in the following manner. We take a
common rocket case, of one inch exterior diameter, and
charge it solid with the ordinary rocket composition. Some
use one spoonful of earth, and three spoonfuls of the composition
for fire lances, piercing the case, and attaching a quick
match. This, however, appears altogether unnecessary, as
the rocket composition is sufficient for the purpose. The
match, in either case, is fixed in the end to set it off. To
the end of the case is attached a dart, made of iron, and very
sharp. This dart is secured in the head, in such a manner
as to be kept firm. A stick is then lashed to the case in the
usual way. It may be sent in the direction required. It appears,
however, that, although it is calculated to be thrown
on an enemy, it has not been much used; nor can it be considered
an active weapon, compared with others, employed
for similar purposes. One use for which it is recommended,
is for the defence of buildings.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XLIV. Of the Firebrand.</i></p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boute-feu</i> of the French, which we have translated
into firebrand, as the most appropriate term in the present
instance, is used as an incendiary, and is nothing more than
a long stick, furnished at one of its ends with two iron
prongs, with sometimes the figure of a dragon's head, on
which is rolled thick rope, previously prepared in the same
manner as tourteaux. One end of this rope passes between
the iron prongs. The boute-feu is calculated to set fire to
buildings, &amp;c. after the retreat of an enemy. It is only a
convenient and expeditious mode of communicating fire.
One end of the stick is pointed, and usually covered with
iron, so as to stick in the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span></p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XLV. Of the Fire Flask.</i></p>

<p>The fire flask, or fire bottle, is a bottle, either square or
round, and charged with grain-powder, mixed with fire-stone,
which is introduced and compressed with a stick.
The bottle is then covered with a cloth, sewed on it, which
is coated with pitch. The mouth is secured with parchment.
When used, a match is inserted, and inflamed. It
is then thrown by the hand.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XLVI. Of the Trompe-Route.</i></p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trompe-route</i> of the French is a light made use of at
sea, to deceive the enemy. It is nothing more than a common
fire lance, one inch in diameter, and twelve inches long,
fixed in the centre of a round plank, which, when lighted,
is let down upon the water. As it floats from the ship, the
lights of the latter being darkened, the enemy, in pursuit,
will follow the light, and by this means the ship escapes.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XLVII. Of Fire-Pots for Ramparts.</i></p>

<p>Rampart fire-pots are used, when an enemy approaches a
work. They are furnished with grain-powder, and charged
grenades without fuses, and sometimes also with fire stone.
The pots are ordinary potters' ware, and, when they contain
the ingredients, are covered with parchment. A match passes
through the opening of the pot, and when used, is inflamed
with a port-fire. The following composition is also used
for rampart pots.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Composition for Rampart Fire-Pots.</i></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl wd70">Saltpetre,</td><td class="tdr wd5">12</td><td class="tdc wd5">&nbsp;parts.&nbsp;</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl">Antimony,</td><td class="tdr">4</td><td class="tdc">&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="p1">These ingredients are mixed in a mortar with the oil of
petroleum, or, if this cannot be had, good spermaceti oil, and
made into a thick paste, about the consistence of dough, and
then rolled into balls. The pots generally hold two rows of
these balls, distributing through them grained powder.
They are then finished by using fire stone composition, beaten
into pieces, and mixed with an equal quantity of grained
powder, and covered with meal-powder to facilitate the inflammation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span></p>

<p>The pots are covered over with parchment, as in the former
case. It is doubtful, whether fire pots, prepared in this
way, have any advantages over those, made in the manner
first described.</p>

<p>As to the shape of fire-pots, some are cylindrical, and
others of the common figure. Sometimes they are furnished
with an iron hoop, with a hook of iron, by which they are
suspended. They are used, when equipped in that way,
more for sea service, as a defence against small boats. They
are hung over the side of the vessel, so as to come in contact
with the boats. When designed in particular for that
use, they are charged with the following composition:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Composition for Fire-Pots, for sea service.</i></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl wd70">Grained powder,</td><td class="tdc wd5">6</td><td class="tdc wd5">&nbsp;lbs.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl">Charcoal,</td><td class="tdc">10</td><td class="tdc">oz.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="p1">With this composition, grenades are used, which are put
into the pot with powder, fire-stone, &amp;c. and a match is fixed
as before mentioned.</p>

<p>We are told, that fire-pots, prepared in this manner, are a
defensive, as well as a dangerous weapon, and that a vessel
in the Indian seas was actually saved by them, when attacked
by pirates. It appears, that she endeavoured to escape from
her pursuers, and finding it in vain, the crew thought of
making, and employing fire-pots, for their defence; as the
number of the pirates was greater than their own crew. The
effect was, that, not expecting that kind of reception, they were
obliged to abandon their enterprize.</p>

<p>There is an incendiary fire-pot, which differs from that
used in fire-works for exhibition, by being made of copper
and very stout. It is charged with pieces of fire-stone, previously
rolled in a paste of meal-powder and brandy. A
charge of powder is put in the pot, and quick-match is fixed,
which must be sufficiently long to hang over the pot, and
then the fire-stone is thrown in. When the match is inflamed,
the powder takes fire, and disperses the fire-stone.
The better plan is to have a communication to the powder
below, as in the pots of ordnance, or mortars for throwing
fire-balloons. We see no particular advantage to be derived
from the use of this pot; as a carcass or fire-ball, thrown
out of a mortar, will do more execution, and at a greater
distance than any of these contrivances. The carcass rocket,
however, may be an exception, if we believe the account we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
have of it. As an incendiary, the fire-stone, put in a shell
with powder, is more effectual than the fire-pot, we have
just described.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XLVIII. Of Inflammable Balls.</i></p>

<p>Count Rumford (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bibliothèque Physico-Economique</cite>, 1812)
has invented a composition, which is very inflammable, and,
as it is used in balls, is for that reason so called. Equal
parts of clay, pitcoal, and charcoal of wood, are mixed together,
(having previously reduced them to powder), and
made into a consistence with water fit to roll into balls.
These balls are then dried for use.</p>

<p>They may be rendered more inflammable, by soaking
them in a strong solution of saltpetre.</p>

<p>Count Rumford, when he recommended the use of clay
with coal, was aware, that, in the combustion of coal, a considerable
part of the heat was lost; whereas, although clay
is incombustible, a greater part of this heat is retained by
the clay, and given out gradually.</p>

<p>The inflammable ball may be considered more in the character
of an economical fuel than in any other.</p>

<p>The only inconvenience attending these balls is, that, when
prepared without nitre, which must add to the expense, they
do not readily inflame; and, therefore, a fire must first be
kindled, before they are used.</p>

<p>While noticing the use of clay in this manner, we may
remark, that the <i>economical brick</i>, as it is called, is made
nearly in the same way.</p>

<p>Two parts of clay, separated from stones, are mixed with
one part of pitcoal. After the fire is kindled, the coal burns
in the same manner, and the clay bakes.</p>

<p>Another composition is given in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bibliothèque Physico-Economique</cite>,
for March, 1812. It is composed of potters'
clay, cow dung, street dirt, saw-dust of wood, turf, horse
dung, straw, and tan. Besides these, pitch, tar, oils, and
other combustible substances, are occasionally used, either
with the above, or mixed with pitcoal in powder.</p>

<p>Observations on this preparation may be seen in the work
quoted, or in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives des Découvertes</cite>, v, p. 137.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. XLIX. Of Pauly's Inflammable Powder.</i></p>

<p>We mentioned, in a note to the article on guns, that
M. Pauly had invented a musket, or fowling piece, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
was discharged by percussion, instead of flint and steel, by
using a priming powder made of chlorate of potassa.</p>

<p>It may be proper, however, to state, that the Rev. Dr.
Forsyth made use of a similar powder, and for the same
purpose, many years ago, of which we have already spoken.
M. Thenard also has given a formula for a preparation of
a similar powder.</p>

<p>A description of M. Pauly's improvement may be seen in
the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives des Découvertes</cite>, for 1812, p. 158, and in that
of 1814, p. 174, where the composition of the powder is noticed;
and also in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bulletin de la Société d'Encouragement</cite>,
for 1814.</p>

<p>This powder is composed as follows:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="85%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl wd80">Chlorate, or hyperoxymuriate of potassa</td><td class="tdl">8 oz.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Flowers of sulphur</td><td class="tdl">3 &mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Charcoal of light wood</td><td class="tdl">2 &mdash;</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="p1">They are mixed together with Cologne water, or in its
place with brandy, to which a small quantity of the solution
of gum arabic is added.</p>

<p>The ingredients must be made as fine as possible, and intimately
blended together.</p>

<p>This powder may be inflamed by a hammer, or by the
condensation of air in a piston, a mode recommended by
Pauly.</p>

<p>We have seen a fowling-piece, constructed according to
M. Pauly's plan, and also the priming powder used.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. L. Of Extemporaneous Fire.</i></p>

<p>There are several preparations, which have the effect of
producing fire either by friction, or chemical action. Some
of these preparations, we have noticed. The causes of spontaneous
combustion may be referred to chemical decomposition,
and the change of quiescent into distributable heat. We
remarked, that a mixture of chlorate of potassa and sugar is
inflamed, when brought in contact with sulphuric acid; that,
in the slaking of quicklime, the heat is sufficient to inflame
oils; that pyrites by decomposition very frequently sets fire
to combustible bodies; that oil of turpentine is inflamed by
nitric acid; that pyrophorus, when exposed to the air, takes
fire, and also phosphorus by slight friction; and that, in all
cases of combustion, either friction, an increase of tempera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>ture,
or the action of some body, which is brought in contact,
are necessary to produce the effect.</p>

<p>Water, when added to some substances and preparations,
will produce fire. Thus potassium readily decomposes it, and
the potassuretted hydrogen gas, which is produced in flames.
The same may be said of phosphuret of lime and water; for
the phosphuretted hydrogen gas inflames, when it comes to
the air.</p>

<p>On some occasions, these substances may be employed as
incendiaries.</p>

<p>Hanzelet remarks, that the following composition will produce
inflammation with water.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Extemporaneous Fire.</i></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="85%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl wd80">Linseed Oil</td><td class="tdl">3 lbs.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Spirit of Turpentine</td><td class="tdl">1 &mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">White of egg</td><td class="tdl">¼ &mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Quicklime</td><td class="tdl">8 &mdash;</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="p1">It is doubtful, however, whether this composition will
have that effect; although the heat produced by the slaking
of quicklime is very considerable, and, as we remarked,
spontaneous combustion, in several instances, has been referred
to its agency. Lime, in the act of slaking, absorbs,
and chemically unites with, water, which becomes solidified,
converting it into a hydrate, whilst its latent caloric is set at
liberty. This is a process, which puts quiescent heat in motion,
to become distributable heat. See <a href="#INTx"><i>Introduction</i>.</a></p>

<p>If the quantity of free caloric, thus generated, be sufficient,
the turpentine and oil will necessarily inflame.</p>

<p>We may add, therefore, that a rapid transition of caloric,
from a latent to a free state, as in combustion, is all that is
required to produce effects of this kind; and, in short, all
cases of spontaneous combustion may be accounted for on
this principle; by considering the cause, which acts in those
instances so powerfully, and in some instances instantaneously,
and which changes caloric from a quiescent to a distributable
state.</p>

<p>Dr. Irvine refers all cases of combustion to a change in
the capacity of bodies for caloric; which depends on the
nature of the products: if they have a greater capacity, no
flame ensues, and the caloric remains more or less quiescent;
if they possess a less capacity, flame is the consequence.
There are exceptions to this doctrine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span></p>

<p>In the emission of caloric, Dr. Black supposes, that it is
given out, in consequence of the resulting attraction of the
new compound for caloric being less than that of its ingredients,
when separate. M. Curadou (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de Physique</cite>, 1809)
observes, that, in preparing the <i>artificial stone</i>, one-half of
which is composed of water, by mixing one part of sulphuric
acid with two parts of clay, and a sufficient quantity of water,
a higher temperature is produced than that of boiling water.
In this instance, we find that, in the formation of sulphate of
alumina, which envelopes the silica, the water is solidified,
as in many other cases, and, while it forms a solid substance,
the caloric of fluidity is liberated. The heat, he remarks, is
sometimes so great as to set fire to inflammable substances.</p>


<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. LI. Of the Indian White Fire.</i></p>

<p>This preparation (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feu blanc Indien</i> of the French) is described
in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives des Découvertes</cite>, &amp;c. vol. ii, p. 300.
It appears, that it was kept secret in France, and was used
by the French astronomers for signals.</p>

<p>In 1807, M. de Zach published some account of it, in his
<cite>Astronomical and Geographical correspondence</cite>.</p>

<p>The case, in which the composition is put, is ten inches in
diameter and four in height; but may be of any size, according
to the quantity of the composition to be burnt, and the
degree of light required. It was seen 40 miles at sea. General
Ray lighted, on the English coast, a case of this fire, which
was seen very distinctly on the French coast.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Composition of White Fire.</i></p>

<tr><td class="tdl">Red arsenic</td><td class="tdc">2 &mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="p1">This powder lights without explosion, and illuminates with
great brilliancy. Care must be taken not to breathe the Arsenical
vapours, which are produced by the combustion.</p>

<p>A case of six inches in diameter, and six inches high,
burns three minutes. The light is said to injure the eyes.</p>

<p>The price of this powder is equal to that of ordinary gunpowder.</p>

<p>The match, which accompanies this preparation when it
is sold, is made in the following manner: Pulverize four
parts of saltpetre, two parts of gunpowder, two parts of charcoal,
and one part of sulphur, and pass them through a <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'seive'">sieve</ins>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
Provide then a number of paper cases, made in the usual
manner, or a roller, about the diameter of a quill, and two
feet in length, and charge with the composition.</p>

<p>This match, when used, is attached to a stick. It will
resist the action both of wind and rain.</p>

<p class="centerx"><i>Sec. LII. Of the Pyrophore of Defence.</i></p>

<p>An apparatus for defence, called the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pyrophore</i>, was announced
in a French publication in 1815. It may be applied,
according to the author, in 24 hours for the defence of towns,
roads, passages, and defiles.</p>

<p>The pyrophore itself is a square box furnished with a lid,
and sufficiently large to contain fifty pounds of gunpowder.
When it is filled, and to be used, it is fixed with cords, or
chains, in such a manner as to be conveyed to a given point.
The lid is furnished with cross pieces, which open it when
necessary.</p>

<p>At the sides of the box are rings, made very strong and
fixed in bolts, which go through the sides, and clenched. To
each of these rings, a cord or chain is attached, furnished at
each end with a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crotchet</i>.</p>

<p>This cord or chain runs upon two fixed <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'pullies'">pulleys</ins>, placed for
instance, at the two extremities of a battery, and is managed
by artillerists. The pyrophore is under cover. When it is
conveyed to a certain place, where a bar or grate is fixed, it
is stopped, by the contrivance before mentioned, the lid is
raised, and the powder falls into a kind of funnel or gutter,
at the end of which the explosion is made, to take effect.</p>

<p>It appears that the inventor had in view the conveyance
of a given quantity of powder to a particular place, and by
carrying a light to it by means of a cord, similarly fixed, to
inflame it, when it had arrived at its destination.</p>

<p>It is impossible to make a machine of this kind effective;
for the difficulty in arranging, and finally managing it, the
enemy taking means to guard against it, are certainly obstacles,
and strong objections to its use. Other means of defence,
which we have pointed out, are preferable; although
we admit, that, in <i>some</i> situations, a contrivance of this sort
might be advantageously used, where, for instance, we wish
to deposite a quantity of powder, to be in readiness for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
approach of an enemy, without exposing men to an attack.
What is more destructive than the thundering barrel, which
is furnished with grenades, &amp;c. &amp;c. if set off among the assailants?

observations abundantly prove. Dr. Fordyce (<cite>Phil. Trans.</cite> vol. 64 &amp; 65)
heated a room by stoves to two hundred and sixty degrees of Fahrenheit's
scale, and remained in it for some time without great inconvenience.
But different metallic substances, as the lock of the door, his watch and
keys lying on the table, could not be touched without burning him: and
although an egg became hard, and his pulse beat one hundred and thirty-nine
per minute, yet a thermometer placed in his mouth was only two or
three degrees hotter than common. He perspired profusely. Jenning's
steam bath will heat the air in contact with the naked body from one hundred
to one hundred and twenty degrees, a <i>heat</i> sufficient, as it is in the
aqueous vapour, resulting from the combustion of alcohol or strong spirit,
to induce a copious diaphoresis in less than half an hour. Having tried
this experiment in several cases, I can only say, that I effected in the
course of an hour, what, under ordinary circumstances, would require
twelve or twenty-four, viz. a <i>copious perspiration</i>, and that too without
the exhibition of sudorifics. The practice is an old one not only among
civilized nations, but aborigines. It is nevertheless worthy of adoption.

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> A writer of the last century remarks, that "he cannot possibly admit
the sun to possess the least manner of heat, but rather to contain the
capabilities of fire, like a stick, or a flint, though with a faculty of expressing
it, by its own action, which the others have not. I imagine its beams
not to be hot, in their rectilineal direction, but productive of this effect,
from reflection, only. If the rays of the sun were fire, in the first instance,
those consequences would naturally follow, that our friend and correspondent
<i>Tria</i> so well describes in his <cite>Day of Judgment</cite>, 'The rivers were
dried up, and liquid ore supplied their burning channels. The clouds were
turned to fire, and shot through the astonished sky. The air was flame,
and breathing was no more. The firmament was melted down, and rained
its sulphur o'er the prostrate globe, &amp;c.' The sun emanates light only, in
the direct line, but owes its heat to reflection. We feel it, therefore, more
intensely, in a valley, than on a hill. Why are the Alps and Pyrennees
crowned with eternal frosts, while the shepherds, with their flocks, are
sheltering their scorching heads from the heat of the sun, at the foot of
them? Why do the upper regions of the air shower down their hail and
snow, to be thawed and melted here below? Why shall a <i>lens</i> of ice receive
the rays above, so coldly, and transmit them so intensely hot, beneath?
Why is it warmer, in summer, though the sun is farther off, than
in winter, when 'tis so much nearer to us? Because of our situation, in
regard to it, only. In the first case the rays are vertical, in others lateral;
and perpendicular reflections are stronger, than oblique ones. We judge
of fire above, from what we feel below, &amp;c."
</p>
<p>
The summit of Ætna, notwithstanding the fire of the volcano, is covered
almost all the year with snow. Fazello, speaking of this says, that
"this region extends nearly twelve miles; and, even in summer, is almost
perpetually covered with snow, and extremely cold: which is the
more wonderful as the summit continually produces, nourishes, and pours
forth flames amid the ice and snow with which it is enveloped." Solinus
says, "Ætna, in a wonderful manner, exhibits snows mixed with fires; and
retains every appearance of the severest winter, amid her vast conflagrations."
</p>
<p>
Silius Italicus, and Claudian, and Pindar, who lived 500 years before
the Christian era, bear testimony to the antiquity of this fact.

The height of Ætna is generally estimated at 11,000 feet above the sea.
In 1755, it issued out a torrent, not of mud, as was supposed, but of snow
and ice melted by the lava. The same thing happened at the volcano of
Cargarossa in South America.

<p>
The celebrated Herschel, (Phil. Trans. 1801, and Nich. Jour. 1. 13),
in considering the construction of the sun, infers it to be a habitable globe
more magnificent than our earth, or other planets, and that its lucid substance
is not a liquid nor an elastic fluid; but that it exists in the manner of
luminous clouds, swimming in the transparent atmosphere of the sun, or
rather of lucid decompositions taking place within that atmosphere. The
<cite>Philosophical Transactions</cite>, 1795, p. 72, also contains remarks on this
lucid matter. Having rejected the old terms of spots, nuclei, penumbræ,
and luculi, he has substituted those of openings, shallows, ridges, nodules,
corrugations, indentations, and pores. The openings are places where the
luminous solar clouds are removed, which he thinks are produced by a
wind or gas from the sun's body. Shallows are depressions below the luminous
clouds, and are caused by the propelling gas, which produces the
openings. They are tufted like masses of clouds. Ridges are elevations of
the luminous clouds. The length of one of the longest was found to be
75,000 miles. They generally surround the openings. Herschel thinks it
probable, from appearances, that the luminous matter is disturbed at top
by the transparent elastic fluid, which issues from the openings. Nodules
are small elevations of the luminous matter. Corrugations are smaller
elevations and depressions of the same matter. Indentations are the dark
places of corrugations. That they are not much depressed, is deduced
from their visibility near the margin of the sun. They are of the same nature
as shallows, and of different sizes. Pores are the low places of indentations.
The doctor is of opinion, that the phenomena before described
could not appear, if the shining matter were a liquid; because, by the laws
of hydrostatics, the openings, shallows, indentations, and pores would be
filled up. Still less could these phenomena exist with the supposition of
elastic fluidity. The shining matter, he concludes, must exist in the manner
of empyreal luminous or phosphoric clouds. The planetary atmosphere
of the sun, its great height, its density, as inferred from the power of gravitation,
which is known to be twenty-seven times stronger at the sun's
surface than with us, and other subjects are also discussed. He supposes
the gas to pass from the sun itself upwards to the region of the clouds, so
as to generate pores, corrugations, &amp;c. He concludes finally, that if this
view of the solar appearances be well founded, there will be no difficulty
in ascertaining the actual state of the sun with regard to its energy in giving
heat and light.
</p>
<p>
In a paper on the "<cite>Construction of the Heavens</cite>," the doctor thinks it probable,
that the great stratum called the milky way is that in which the sun
is placed, though perhaps not in the centre of its thickness. The celebrated
astronomer Lalande supposes the <i>spots</i> before mentioned to be parts of
the solid body of the sun, but admits not a luminous atmosphere, but a luminous
ocean. For the observations of Dr. Young, see his <cite>Natural Philosophy</cite>,
and of sir <i>Isaac Newton</i>, his <cite>Principia</cite>, &amp;c. Consult also Biot.
</p>
<p>
Sir Isaac Newton has asserted, according to Nicholson, (<cite>British Encyclopedia</cite>)
"that the density of the sun's heat, which is proportioned to
his light, is seven times as great in Mercury as with us, and that water
there would be all carried off in the shape of steam, for, he found, by experiments
with the thermometer, that a heat seven times greater than that
of the sun's beams in summer will serve to make water boil." That fixed
stars are of the same nature as the sun, since they agree with it in several
particulars, as in the property of emitting light continually, and in retaining
constantly their relative situation with but little variation, is generally
admitted. They are supposed also to emit heat as well as light. The
sun is, therefore, considered a fixed star comparatively near us, and the
fixed stars, which seem as centres to other systems of worlds, as suns at
immense distances from us. Taking the distance of the sun from us to be,
as is found by calculation, 95,000,000 miles, we may infer, that every
thing must be scorched up at its surface; but this question is put at rest,
if we consider that the sun's rays act on a calorific medium, as the cause
of changing quiescent into distributable heat. May not light itself, by some
process unknown to us, produce calorific rays? That heat and light are
both material, and possess some properties in common, that for instance,
of reflection and refraction, are facts well known; but to account for the
peculiar agency of light, if it be admitted, is a problem, which, perhaps,
will never be settled?</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> <i>Fire</i> must have been a very potent instrument in the hands of Hannibal,
if we believe what Livy and Pliny assert respecting the means he
employed in crossing the Alps, which took him fifteen days, after meeting
with almost every obstacle. Livy tells us, that Hannibal softened the rock
by pouring vinegar upon it, after it had first been made hot under flaming
piles of huge trees! M. Rollin quotes Pliny to prove that vinegar has the
<i>force</i> to break stones and rocks! This story is altogether fabulous; for
in the first place, had he vinegar sufficient; and, secondly, who ever knew
that vinegar had force, or even the power of dissolving primitive rocks,
such as granite or gneiss; and, thirdly, if it possessed the power stated by
Pliny, and had he a sufficient quantity, where was his wood? For Polybius
assures us, that Hannibal had no wood to make a fire with, and that there
was not a tree in the place, where he then was, nor near it. That Hannibal
passed over the Alps into Italy, and at an inclement season of the year,
is certain, and that it was one of the greatest achievements that an enterprising
commander ever accomplished, is generally admitted.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Respiration is a mechanical and chemical process, and consists in alternate
inhalation and exhalation, which, in consequence of the oxygen gas
in the air, effects a change in the venous blood that enters the lungs from
the pulmonary artery. Now as this blood is charged with carbon, to which
its dark purple colour is owing, it is carried off in union with oxygen in
the form of carbonic acid. Hence carbonic acid is produced in respiration
and the venous blood is changed into the bright red arterial blood. A
common sized man will consume about 46 thousand cubic inches of oxygen
<i>per diem</i>; equivalent to 125 cubic feet of air, and makes about twenty
respirations in a minute, or for every seven pulsations breathes twice.</p></div>

drew my attention at an early period of life. In the Aurora of Philad.
I published a series of essays on this and other subjects, which, from the
letters received at that time, I flatter myself tended in some degree to advance
the manufacturing interest in the United States; an interest, which
is connected with our individual and national prosperity, and the <i>permanent</i>
and <i>practical</i> independence of the republic. These essays were entitled
"Application of chemistry to the arts and manufactures," and published
in 1808. I have since enlarged that plan in the Artist's Manual,
&amp;c. 2 vols. 8vo. While noticing this subject we may add, that, having
the honour of being one of the few of the original society of Philadelphia
for the promotion of National Industry, whose essays excited, as they claimed,
the attention of the citizens of the United States, much is due to the
indefatigable labours of some of the members of that association. We are
greatly indebted to the able and masterly pen of <span class="smcap">Samuel Jackson</span> M. D.
Professor of Pharmacy in the college of Apothecaries, of Philadelphia, for
many of the best essays it produced, whose disinterested motives, liberal
and exalted mind, and pure patriotic feeling prompted him to the laudable
undertaking; and whose essays were full, clear, and comprehensive.
Viewing his talents, his worth, his merit, we may truly add, that he is not
only an honour to the country which gave him birth, but an ornament to
the age in which he lives. The able address of the Philadelphia Linnæan
society, penned and signed by him, the late Samuel Benezet M. D.,
and the author, as a committee, although written many years ago, contains
the principles, which are now advocated for the support and encouragement
of national industry. This address was calculated, however,
to promote, at the same time, the interests of Natural History.</p></div>

may be cleansed by throwing it into a bright fire. It is then restored
to a dazzling white colour. Pliny, the naturalist, saw table cloths, towels,

says, they became better cleansed than if they had been washed.

The imposition of causing statues to speak, as the head of Orpheus
in the island of Lesbos, the Æsculapius of Alexander, &amp;c. may be readily
perceived, when Lucius relates, that, in the case of Alexander's oracle,
he took instead of a pipe, the gullet of a crane, and transmitted the voice
through it to the mouth of the statue! Bishop Theophilus, in the fourth
century, broke to pieces the statues at Alexandria. He found some
which were hollow, and placed in such a manner against a wall, that a
priest could slip unperceived behind them, and speak to the ignorant
populace through their mouths. Professor Beckman observes, "that the
Pagan priests, like our jugglers, were afraid that their deceptions, if long
practised, might be discovered. They considered it, therefore, as more
secure to deliver the answers themselves, or cause them to be delivered
by women instructed for that purpose, or by writings, or by any other
means. We read, nevertheless, that idols, and the images of saints once
spoke; for at present the latter will not venture to open their mouths. If
their votaries ever really heard a voice proceed from the statue, it may
have been produced in the before-mentioned manner." We think, that a
contrivance, similar to the bull of Phalaris, in the place of hollow statues,
would furnish a good reality.

cubical, should be doubled. The philosophers of Athens immediately
applied themselves to discover the duplicature of the cube, which henceforward
was called the Delian Problem, and continued for a long time to
be an object of the keenest pursuit to the curious. The first who discovered
the solution was Hippocrates Chias.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> There is a sort of mountebanks not only in Ceylon, but in many
other parts of the East Indies, who make a trade of taming serpents,
which they pretend to do by <i>incantation</i>, and carry them about by way of
show. I once witnessed the <i>taming</i> of a serpent, a black snake about
four feet in length, by an English gentleman at Harrowgate, in the
neighbourhood of Philadelphia. He was remarkably fond of snakes for
<i>pets</i>, and had them not only to follow him, but also to be about in the
house among his children, who became familiar with them; and, although
young myself, I observed that they were passive and obedient, and knew
by instinct their <i>dependence</i> on his favours.
</p>
<p>
The <i>incantation</i>, that Mr. C&mdash;d used, was simply this: The snake was
put into a room, and Mr. C. took in with him a bowl of milk, and the
door was closed. Having taken off his coat, and put on a glove, he proceeded
towards his antagonist, who, being prepared for the attack, made
at him, but was repulsed; a second and third attempt was made, but he
was thrown back as before. The snake finding himself <i>mastered</i>, did not
think proper to renew the combat, and crawled into the corner panting
for breath. Mr. C. now took some of the milk and placed it before him,
without the least fear, and after he had finished it, he gave him more. This
he continued until the snake was satisfied. After which, to the astonishment
of all who witnessed the experiment, he took it up, and having
wound itself round his arm, he carried it home. Whether he examined
his mouth, destroyed the fang, or the vesicular sac, (if it had one), I do
not recollect; but this same snake was afterwards a <i>great favorite</i>, and
would follow his master like a dog, and even play about with the children.
I mention this incident to show, that serpents possess considerable instinct,
and are, like domestic animals, conscious of their friends and benefactors,
and may be trained in the same manner.
</p>
<p>
In the island of Ceylon, there is a small animal called the Indian Ichneumon,
which destroys snakes in abundance; but, what is remarkable, he
only attacks them in an open place, where he has an opportunity of running
to a certain herb, which he knows instinctively to be an antidote
against the poison of the bite, if he should happen to receive one. The
monkeys of India, knowing the malignity of snakes, make a business of
hunting and destroying them at night; after seizing them, they carry them
to a stone, and beat their heads until the fangs are destroyed, and then
exultingly throw them in the air. The poison is lodged in two small
vesicles, and when the animal bites they are squeezed, and the poison
is forced through the fangs into the wound. If the vesicles be extracted,
or the liquid prevented from flowing into the wound, the bite is harmless.</p></div>

1800, by Mr. Baker. He proceeded only a small distance into it. On the

and two nights, this family wandered in total darkness, though sometimes
within the hearing of a cataract, when, fortunately, Mrs. Baker, in attempting
to support herself on a rock, perceived that it was wet. She conjectured
that it was caused by the mud, which they had brought in upon
their feet. Baker immediately ascended the rock, and saw the light of day.</p></div>

compounded; but there is no certainty, as to what it is composed of, or
what modifications it may assume. That it is, however, a chemical combination,
and may be decomposed, and destroyed by chemical agents, appears
equally true. The disinfecting apparatus of Morveau, sundry fumigations,
&amp;c. are used for this purpose. The proper destroyers of these gaseous
poisons, are nitric acid vapour, muriatic acid, and chlorine. The
two last are the most effectual. How would chlorine gas act on prussine
gas, or cyanogen? Would it not deprive it of its carbon, forming the
chlorocarbonic acid, and thus set the azote at liberty, or might it not
unite with the nitrogen, and form a chloride of nitrogen? Suppose the
cyanogen to be combined with hydrogen, the decomposition of the hydrocyanic
acid would be effected first by the chlorine combining with the
hydrogen, forming muriatic acid, and secondly with the carbon, forming
chlorocarbonic acid. If hydrogen, in any other combination, should
exist, would not the chlorine in every case decompose such compound,
and thereby destroy its deletereous properties by taking away its hydrogen?
I think it will be proved, some time or other, that the miasma,
which produces yellow fever, is a compound of carbon and azote, with
hydrogen, acting under particular circumstances and conditions.
</p>
<p>
Various other means, besides those we have stated, have been recommended
to prevent the effect of contagious matter, such as odoriferous
substances, preparations of camphor, aromatic vinegar, called the vinegar
of four thieves, &amp;c. but all come short of the effect, and may be regarded
as nostrums. The vapour of burning sulphur, or sulphurous acid,
is used in the East against the plague; but this is inferior to either of the
other acids, of which chlorine, formerly called oxymuriatic acid, is to be
preferred. A mixture of four parts of common salt, one of black oxide of
manganese, and two of sulphuric acid, or muriatic acid poured on manganese
or red lead, will generate chlorine gas. Morveau's disinfecting apparatus
contains the above mixture. The free use of this gas in apartments,
&amp;c. &amp;c. cannot be too strongly recommended.</p></div>

some experiments, to prove the certain, cheap, and simple method of securing
houses against fire, without making use of either brick, stones,
tiles, iron, or any such incombustible material. A building, entirely constructed
of wood, and of lath and plaster, with a very small quantity of
sand laid under the floors, which were of deal, was attempted to be set
on fire by means of a large quantity of dry burning fuel, faggots, straw,
pitch and other combustibles, with which the lower room of this building
was filled, from the floor to the ceiling almost in every part. The whole
mass of fire burnt out without doing the least damage. Those who were
in the next story, directly over the conflagration, did not perceive the
least degree of heat. A wooden stair case, made in the same manner, also
resisted the flames.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> The imitation of thunder, rain, hail, &amp;c. for theatrical purposes, is
variously performed. Mr. Nicholson, in describing an exhibition he saw
in London, (See <a href="#PHAx">Phantasmagoria</a>,) remarks, that thunder was imitated
very accurately, by means of sheet iron plates. The noise of rain and
hail may be imitated by procuring a thin hollow cylinder of wood, about
ten inches wide, and two or three feet long; dividing its inside into five
equal parts, by boards, placed obliquely, of five or six inches, observing
to let there be between them and the wooden circle, a space of about
one-sixth of an inch, and then introducing about four or five pounds of
shot, and turning it upside down. The shot will pass through the various
partitions, and resemble the fall of rain. If large shot be used, the
noise will be increased, and resemble hail.
</p>
<p>
According to the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire de l'Industrie</cite>, (article <i>Tonnerre
artificiel</i>), thunder is imitated, by making a hexangular case of sheet
iron, and putting stones or small balls into it, and rolling it more or less
swiftly. Another mode is to roll cannon balls on a floor, on which is
loosely nailed, at certain distances apart, strips of wood or lath. A clap
of thunder is imitated by letting fall on each other, very suddenly, a
number of sheet iron plates, having them previously suspended, or strung
on a cord, which must be vertical. In 1784, M. Michael, (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de
Paris</cite>) made a machine, which imitated thunder, so completely, as either
to produce the most violent clap, or the most distant rumbling, with intermediate
variations. Parchment, stretched over a frame, has likewise,
been used for the same purpose. The distant thunder may be represented
in this manner; but, to produce a sharp noise, or clap, something more
is required.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> Whoever walked the streets of Rome, at night, without a lantern,
was under the necessity of creeping home in perfect darkness, and in
great danger, like Alexis, in Athenæus. Antioch, Rome, and a few other
cities had public lanterns in streets which were most frequented. Libanus,
who lived in the beginning of the fourth century, in praising his native
city, Antioch, says, that "the light of the sun is succeeded by other
lights, which are far superior to the lamps lighted by the Egyptians on the
festival of Minerva of Sais. The night differs from the day only in the
appearance of the light. With regard to labour and employment, every
thing goes on well. Some work continually; but others laugh and amuse
themselves with singing." In another passage, in the oration to Ellibichus,
the same author tells us, that the ropes from which the lamps that
ornamented the city were suspended, had been cut by some riotous soldiers,
not far from a bath. "Proceeding," says he "to a bath, not far off,
they cut, with their swords, the ropes, from which were suspended the
lamps that afforded light in the night-time, to show that the ornaments of
the city ought to give way to them." Jerome also makes it appear, that
Antioch was lighted with lamps; for, he remarks, that, in an altercation
between a Luciferan and an Orthodox, an adherent to the schismatic Lucifer
disputed in the street with a true believer, till the streets were
lighted, when the listening crowd departed, and that they spat in each
other's face, and retired. Edessa, in Syria, was lighted in the fifth century,
and the governor of that city ordered, that a part of the oil, which was
before given to the churches and monasteries, should be burnt in the
streets. While illuminations were considered emblematical of public
rejoicing, the reverse was considered a token of public sorrow; to denote
which, on occasions of great misfortune, it was customary not to light
the streets. Valerius quotes a passage of Libanius in proof of this assertion,
where it is said, that the people of Antioch, in order to mitigate the
anger of the emperor, bethought themselves of lighting either no lamps,
or a very small number. In 1588, Paris was lighted up with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">falots</i>, or
vases filled with pitch, rosin, and other combustibles. The Abbé Laudati
let out torches and lanterns in Paris, in 1662.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> Since 1792, musket-balls are seven-twelfths of an inch in diameter,
and twenty go to the pound instead of eighteen. In the British service,
eleven bullets to the pound are used for the proof of muskets, and fourteen
in the pound, or twenty-nine in two pounds, for service; seventeen for the
proof of carbines, and twenty for service; and twenty-eight in the pound,
for the proof of pistols, and thirty four for service. The diameter of musket-bullets
differs but one-fiftieth part from that of the musket bore; for if
the shot but just rolls into the barrel, it is sufficient.
</p>
<p>
The diameter of any bullet is found, by dividing 1.6706 by the cube
root of the number, which shows how many of them make a pound, or it
may be done in a shorter way. From the logarithm .2228756 of 1.6706,
subtract continually the third part of the logarithm of the number of
bullets in the pound, and the difference will be the logarithm of the
diameter required. Thus the diameter of a bullet, whereof twelve weigh
a pound, is found by subtracting .3597270, a third part of the logarithm
of 12, from the given logarithm .2228756; or, when the logarithm
is less than the former, a unit must be added, so as to have 1.2228756,
and the difference .8631486 will be the logarithm of the diameter sought,
which is .7297 inches; observing that the number found will always be a
decimal, when the logarithm, which is to be subtracted is greater than
that of the pound; because the divisor is greater than the dividend in this
case.
</p>
<p>
Hence, from the specific gravity of lead, the diameter of any bullet may
be found from its given weight: for, since a cube foot weighs 11325 ounces,
and 678 is to 355, as the cube 1728 of a foot, or 12 inches, is the content
of the sphere; which therefore is, 5929.7 is to 16 ounces, or a pound, as the
cube 1728 is to the cube of the diameter of a sphere which weighs a pound;
which cube therefore is 4.66263, and its root 1.6706 inches, the diameter
sought.</p></div>

years ago, at Camden, opposite Philadelphia. This was a balloon of an
oblong shape, intended to float in the air like a ship on water, and furnished
with oars or wings. It was filled with hydrogen gas. The object
was to direct it, (a desideratum in aerostation), like a vessel on water;
but the aeronaut, having arose in his car to the height of a lombardy poplar,
which came in contact with it, and judging a retreat was preferable,
leaped on a limb, where he had the misfortune to be caught by the seat of
his pantaloons, and appeared, as it were, suspended between heaven and
earth, to the no small diversion of thousands of spectators. The balloon
ascended to some height, and then turned, throwing out his sand bags, &amp;c.

of course, a contrary feeling. Lee called on me the next day,
and, in explanation of the cause, observed, that, when he ascended to the
height mentioned, he found the centre of gravity was shifting, and thought
it prudent not to venture. I observed, that it was well he changed his
gravity, but was sorry to find, that he had transferred his centre a posteriori.</p></div>

purposes. The fougasses are small mines, whose line of resistance
is only six to six and two-thirds feet. They are used to defend large posts.
Bomb fougasses are nothing more than fougasses, charged with bombs
containing powder. To estimate the effects of bomb fougasses, artillerists
have ascertained the exact quantity of powder contained in each kind of
bomb. A bomb of eight and a half inches weighs forty-six and a half
pounds; it requires four and a half pounds of powder to fill it; but one
pound will burst it. The eighteen inch bomb, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cominage</i>, weighs nearly
five hundred and seventy-one pounds, and contains forty pounds of powder
Thirteen pounds of powder will burst it. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">camouflet</i> is a small fougasse,
made to act against the enemy's mines, to suffocate and poison
their branch. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">camouflet</i> is also used to act against the sides of the
crater of a mine that has been sprung. See <cite>Science of War and Fortification</cite>,
vol. 2d, p. 286.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_43_43" id="Footnote_43_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_43"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> Certain plants, we have said, are made use of for this purpose. Botanists
have certain rules for distinguishing poisonous plants, from those
which are innocent. Professor Eaton (Manual of Botany, &amp;c. p. 17) observes,
that plants with five stamens and one pistil, with a dull coloured
lurid corol, and of a nauseating sickly smell, are always poisonous; as
tobacco, thorn-apple, henbane, night-shade. The degree of poisonous
property diminished, when the flower is brighter coloured, and the smell,
less nauseous. He also observes, that umbelliferous plants of the aquatic
kind, and of a nauseating scent, are always poisonous; as water-hemlock
and cow-parsley. But if they grow in dry land, and their smell is pleasant,
they are not poisonous; as <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'fennell'">fennel</ins>, dill, &amp;c. Snap dragon, foxglove,
and plants, generally, with labiate corols, and seeds in capsules,
are poisonous, and also those plants which exude a milky juice when broken,
unless they bear compound flowers; as milk-weed and dog-bane. It
is understood, also, that plants having any appendage to the calyx or
corol, and eight or more stamens, are generally poisonous.</p></div>

<p class="pfs120">DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;A. is the entering rammer or driver. It is bored
in such a manner, that the whole of the broach, or piercer
above the nipple, n, may be admitted. The cavity of the
bore is cylindrical, and equal in diameter to that of the
foot of the broach. This driver serves to fix the rocket case,
over the broach, in the mould G, and to form the cup, o, fig.
10, for receiving the priming.</p>

<p>B. is the driver of the first charge. It is bored in such a
manner, as to admit the broach to within two-fifths of the
interior diameter of the case, from its base. Its bore is cylindrical,
and has the diameter of the broach, at the height
of two-fifths the interior diameter of the case.</p>

<p>C. is the driver of the second charge, and admits the broach
two-thirds of its length; the diameter of its bore being
the same as that of the broach, at one-third of its height.</p>

<p>D. is the driver of the third charge, and admits one-third of
the broach; the diameter of the bore being that of the
broach, at two-thirds of its height.</p>

<p>E. is the last driver, and is solid; the charge being above
the summit of the broach. See page 231.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span> and <span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span> (cont.) and <span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>&mdash;The broach or piercer I, fig. 1,
(a section of which is represented in fig. 6), is a truncated cone,
having a hemispherical summit. The cone is the part from a to
b, fig. 6. The diameter of the base of the cone at b, ought to
be two-fifths of the interior diameter of the case, and the diameter
at the summit, one-fifth, which is also the diameter of the
small hemisphere at the top. The height from b to a, ought to
be seven times the interior diameter of the case, or 17.5 times
the diameter of the base b. The part n, fig. 1, and from b
to c, fig. 6, is rounded. Its diameter ought to be that of
the interior of the case, and its height, seven-tenths of that
diameter. This is called the nipple, and is the part, which
gives shape to the cup o, fig. 10. The part m, fig. 1, and
from c to d, fig. 6, is cylindrical, and may be made of any
height or diameter, provided the latter is not less than that
of the cone. It is generally one-twentieth more than the
exterior diameter. This part ought to penetrate into the
bottom of the charging mould, G, fig. 1, and fit closely, so
as to be firm. The part from d to e, fig. 6, is the blade or
tongue of the broach. It is rectangular, and enters into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[612]</a></span>
block H, fig. 1, where it is firmly fixed. The size of this
part is arbitrary, as well as that of the block H, fig. 1.</p>

for example '21 lbs.' in place of '21lbs.'</p>

<p>Fractions, usually in the form '14 3-4' in the original text,
have been converted to the form '14<span class="xs"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>' in this etext.</p>

<p>Also, in a few larger tables with italic styling on some text, this
italic styling has been removed, for consistency with the .txt version.
In a few cases a word has been abbreviated to conserve table space:
    cal. = caliber; diam. = diameter.</p>

<p>Some instances of <i>Tome</i> in French citations have been changed
to Tome (no italic), for consistency.</p>

<p>Some accents and spelling in French citations have been corrected.</p>

<p>For consistency, instances of 'fireworks' and 'fire works' have
been changed to the predominant form 'fire-works'.</p>

<p>Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been
corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within
the text and consultation of external sources.</p>

<p>Except for those changes noted above and below, misspelling in the
text, and inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained.
For example: meal-powder, meal powder; quick-match, quick match,
quickmatch; siege, seige; musket, musquet; hazle; dodecaedron;
deposite; inclose.</p>
